Traineeship Track projects may have a duration of up to 5 years and a maximum budget of $3 million.
Budgets can include support for faculty during the academic year and summer. It can also include funds to support faculty professional development, travel for trainees, equipment and supplies that are directly needed or related to the training provided to students.
Projects are expected to budget for a half or full time project coordinator.
However, keep in mind that direct costs for trainee stipends, cost of education, and programmatic elements must be commensurate with the goals of the proposal.
Also keep in mind that stipends are intended to be for trainees whose research is aligned with the projectâ€™s research theme and must be a minimum of $34,000 for a consecutive 12-month appointment. Students cannot be charged for tuition or any other required costs while receiving an NRT stipend.
