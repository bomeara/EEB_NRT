Think about real-world applications, esp with Paul, Xingli, and Mona.

https://www.nanoporetech.com/ : We might take a look at thus “pocket” nextgen sequencing.  Cost $1000.   It requires 200 ng DNA.  This can sequence an entire virus genome and can prepare a 7X library in an extremely short time. 48 flow cells.   This kind of technology could be included in a training module for students for the training grant proposal together with genomic sequencing.  Anyone up for giving it a try?
