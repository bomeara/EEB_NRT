Letters of Intent (required):

A Letter of Intent (LOI) submitted by the lead institution only is required for proposal submissions planned for either NRT track. Limits on the number of proposals submitted per institution and per PI/coPI also apply to the Letters of Intent. Letters of Intent are not reviewed but are used to gauge review requirements. They are not used as pre-approval mechanisms for the submission of proposals, and no feedback is provided to the submitters.
