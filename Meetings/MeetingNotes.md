## Introduction of grant

Two tracks. We're going for the $3M grant to train lots of students (past awards have funded ~18-30 students and trained up to 155). See https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Criteria.md for criteria. In short, the grants are targeted for training in "Understanding the Brain", "Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems", or "other". We're going for the other, though the food/energy/water might also be in scope. Our direction comes from a call from Susan K. -- a summary is

*We have a key national need for "next gen taxonomists" (may need better name to avoid confusion with next gen seq). People who are a mixture of muddy boot naturalists with the analytical and methodological skills to predict species movements, create models, etc. UTK EEB (and friends) are uniquely positioned to fill this need.*

Each institution is limited to 2 proposals. There's at least one other going in, perhaps more, so we need to indicate our interest to the research office.

## Today's goals

* Work through the topic in more detail, brainstorming ideas.
* Fill out https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/GrantDocuments/UT_Limited_Submission.md
  * Potential collaborators
  * Info required for 2-3 paragraphs outlining grant

## Action items

* Summarize material & submit to research office: **Brian**
