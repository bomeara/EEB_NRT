## Introduction of grant

Two tracks. We're going for the $3M grant to train lots of students (past awards have funded ~18-30 students and trained up to 155). See https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Criteria.md for criteria. In short, the grants are targeted for training in "Understanding the Brain", "Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems", or "other". We're going for the other, though the food/energy/water might also be in scope. Our direction comes from a call from Susan K. -- a summary is

*We have a key national need for "next gen taxonomists" (may need better name to avoid confusion with next gen seq). People who are a mixture of muddy boot naturalists with the analytical and methodological skills to predict species movements, create models, etc. UTK EEB (and friends) are uniquely positioned to fill this need.*

Each institution is limited to 2 proposals. There's at least one other going in, perhaps more, so we need to indicate our interest to the research office.

## Today's goals

* Review criteria: https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Criteria.md
* Work through the topic in more detail, brainstorming ideas.
* Fill out https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/GrantDocuments/UT_Limited_Submission.md
  * Potential collaborators
  * Info required for 2-3 paragraphs outlining grant

## Discussion

Goal: Next gen biodiversity researchers. Taxonomy is part of it, GIS is part of it, international is part of it, working with agencies. Building capacity that's going away. Kind of in perfect storm (in positive sense): the median age of people in boots on the ground in agencies is ~65. We're losing the people with the field, taxonomy knowledge to do assessments, biodiversity studies. Could be exportable approach: The Tennessee model for training in biodiversity.

* iDigBio: mapping patterns on trees. Talk at BSA. Pam Soltis group.
* Professional programs. Professional masters degrees in science, like they have in business. Pulls in nontraditional students, ones who already have jobs and want a credential. Perhaps include training as project managers. Paying students, not TA supported.
* Model from an existing igert: people from different depts working on solving enviro problems. First year: seminars on issues relating to international institutional research. Had side projects with people in Canada (but nothing came from the side projects). Had to go abroad in second year. Seminars were effective in cohort building.
* Logic model: sustain, audience
* Could work with TVA, the park for environmental goals.
* What can we do that's not already being done in Forest, Wildlife, and Fisheries (we could absorb them into this grant).
* Training in FWF is different from EEB. We want people who can be leaders of the direction.
* Introduce novel technologies vs retro (classic) knowledge.
* Maybe crossing scales should be an emphasis. Not just pop bio of particular species (as in FWF): also communities, pop gen.
* From genomes to biomes: generating next gen taxonomists. Integrate scales and taxonomy, also mechanisms.
* Make sure to emphasize non-academic track as a goal.
* Internship as a component.
* Joe Clark part of USGS would be good contact: what people need to know: leadership, project management, in addition to bio.
* Taxonomy: do by biome: taxonomy of fish, mussels, and other freshwater things; teach skills in dichotomous keys.
* Train in one subspecialty (fieldwork, recognize biodiversity in the field). Learn same concepts, but with a specialty.
* include training in genetics, eDNA, barcoding, multiplexing: important for community ecology, systematics.
* Training in spatial skills. LiDAR to understand biodiversity on the ground, drones.
* Training in decisions you'll need to make in a career (management, etc.). Need project management training, social science.
* Maybe talk to business school about management training
* Have the students connect to each other: some way to have them interact. Partner.
* Outreach to agencies, Tremont or other educational groups.
* How to get buy in from faculty. Why encourage students to go intern for a semester, rather than work on your lab's core stuff? How to demonstrate this to NSF.
*

# Agreed

* Next gen Naturalists
* Internships
* Meeting to invite outside agencies / groups to ask them what they need in people to hire.
* Two week field courses
*
