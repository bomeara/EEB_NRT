## Status so far

* Business school will charge for placements. They have experience here, but probably not worth it overall.
* Thanos Papanicolaou of Dept of Civil and Enviro Engineering offered help with finding internships and links to existing collaborations, willing to write letter of support. I'd suggest him as a senior personnel to help with this.
* Ernest Brothers suggested emphasis on mentorship within the program. Unable to join as senior personnel, but we can point to the [Office of Graduate Training and Mentorship](http://gradschool.utk.edu/training-and-mentorship/) for their services
* Word on the street is that sustainability is a key aspect of getting an NRT funded.

## Team discussion

### Introductions

### Feedback from internal review

* Our story is expanding the box of biology training to other types of opportunities besides traditional paths. This doesn't come across yet.
* The core idea of the grant is good, but it doesn't come across as that innovative or novel.
* It's not clear how non-core students are being involved.
* We should be more creative on broader impacts. How can the cores students, through internships or assignments in traditional courses, be put in front of the broader community: presentations, publicize field surveys, service learning, etc.
* They liked our focus on diverse student recruiting. They suggest more evidence that we do it:
  * Info about current diversity in our programs (include both US and int'l students)
  * Evidence of links to HBCUs
* We should also include data on retention.
* Having the external evaluators is good, but they were also happy with our internal eval for quality improvement. EEB now has custom sofware for this: could highlight this more (and, my thought, push out to the depts of others involved in the grant to also aggregate this data).
* It wasn't clear what the non-EEB departments were doing: clarify the structure.
* They suggested we add more diversity in core faculty, since we're all flavors of biologists. Add folks from business school and/or engineering. Such a person could give links for field placement, talks on management, etc.
* We say the smokies are diverse, but we should compare to other areas. My thought is heat maps of diversity of various taxa across the US to show this. While we're at it, we could include some other map showing economically why we're the place for the grant: per capita income, college education, wealth, unemployment, etc. Could be compelling, especially for NSF in the future, to show how we have great stuff to study and great need for resources. We could even scrape data on number of people in various bio related professions across the country (i.e., linkedin has an API, though I'm not sure if this sort of use is allowed; I'm also still scraping the Texas A&M jobs board that Charlie recommended).

### Discussion of goals, objectives, etc.

### NOTES

Nontraditional paths: not communicated or not exciting?

What makes this unique or novel: **Need to brainstorm on what makes achieves that.**

Partnering for broader impacts document.

Connections to our existing alumni as potential mentors could be cool aspect.

Letters can have some more info than typical, but watch it.

Forest service has contacts on campus

Our connection with PEER on diversity, recruiting could be strength. Put in grant. They have data on placement, we can get that.

This proposal extends what we've learned from PEER to non-NIH areas of science

Identify what is lacking in institutional and national training.

* Some of this could come from partners
  * Data on skills that are needed, what training they have to do after the fact
* Some from mission statements in documents, see what's lacking

Improved communications skills is an expected outcome: must have rubrics for measuring progress (page 9 of RFP)
  * At UT, Littman has science communications courses. May have rubrics already?

Rubrics for admission of students, how we decide who gets the students in

Zomchick may have info on other diversity.

Mention that the model of training across departments works from PEER example

#### Goals of grant

* Training workers in next gen biodiversity
* Training in management skills

#### Concrete objectives for these goals

#### Activities to accomplish those

#### What to measure

### Balancing between the different depts

* Ideal split of lines between the departments? Or play by ear?

### Possible internships

* See https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Ideas.md

## Timeline

* Budget: Dec 20
  * 30 student-years (15 students, two years each): $30K
  * Broader impacts
  * Coordinator
* Draft 1: Dec 21
* Jan 6 meeting with group, 9 am
* Draft 2: Jan 10
* Draft 3: Jan 16 (proposal 75% done)
* Gap analysis: Jan 19 (proposal 90% done, budget done)
* Cayuse begin: Jan 20
* Cayuse done: Jan 27
* Submit to NSF: Feb 3

## TODO

* Figure out how to add novelty
* Look at past NSF grants (on our NRT website)
* Need to figure out how to communicate we're hitting NSF priorities: 10 big ideas (diversity is one of them), budget link. *Sharon to send to group*
  * Average age of field scientists is high (65-ish). Aging workforce in govt infrastruture, and they lack the evo, eco, stats knowledge. Need to bridge that knowledge gap. *Brian to find data on this*. Bureau of Labor and Statistics may have data on that, or census.
  * Smoky Mountains region -- lots of migration into mountains with climate warming *Susan to send paper on this movement*. Also hotspot of diversity. Focus on natural resources: may need wordsmithing.
  * Workforce development as key need to focus on. Alumni with consulting companies.
    * *Sharon to connect us with UT Grad school for internships*
    * Possible to get survey for needs
    * *Charlie: folks in his dept know contacts for consulting, etc. Connections to agencies*
    * Department of economic and community development has ideas of needs *Sharon*
* Grad student outcome
  * *Brian EEB*
  * *Meg entomology*
  * *Charlie forestry*
  * *Sharon and Brian to talk to Ernest Brothers about UT-level stuff*
  * *Susan: talk to PEER on data, coordinating with them for recruitment*
* *Charlie: identify internship partners, talk to them about what they need for Masters and PhD student skills*
  * Hardest data to get will be "areas of need"
  * Focus on data that will support proposal goals
* Start thinking about UT support for sustainability. Is a focus of the RFP, make it explicit.
  * Look at ways to do sustainability. Could just sustain pieces
    * Grad internship could be sustained

## Introduction of grant

Two tracks. We're going for the $3M grant to train lots of students (past awards have funded ~18-30 students and trained up to 155). See https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Criteria.md for criteria. In short, the grants are targeted for training in "Understanding the Brain", "Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems", or "other". We're going for the other, though the food/energy/water might also be in scope. Our direction comes from a call from Susan K. -- a summary is

*We have a key national need for "next gen taxonomists" (may need better name to avoid confusion with next gen seq). People who are a mixture of muddy boot naturalists with the analytical and methodological skills to predict species movements, create models, etc. UTK EEB (and friends) are uniquely positioned to fill this need.*

Each institution is limited to 2 proposals. There's at least one other going in, perhaps more, so we need to indicate our interest to the research office.

## Today's goals

* Review criteria: https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/Criteria.md
* Work through the topic in more detail, brainstorming ideas.
* Fill out https://github.com/bomeara/EEB_NRT/blob/master/GrantDocuments/UT_Limited_Submission.md
  * Potential collaborators
  * Info required for 2-3 paragraphs outlining grant

## Discussion

Goal: Next gen biodiversity researchers. Taxonomy is part of it, GIS is part of it, international is part of it, working with agencies. Building capacity that's going away. Kind of in perfect storm (in positive sense): the median age of people in boots on the ground in agencies is ~65. We're losing the people with the field, taxonomy knowledge to do assessments, biodiversity studies. Could be exportable approach: The Tennessee model for training in biodiversity.

* iDigBio: mapping patterns on trees. Talk at BSA. Pam Soltis group.
* Professional programs. Professional masters degrees in science, like they have in business. Pulls in nontraditional students, ones who already have jobs and want a credential. Perhaps include training as project managers. Paying students, not TA supported.
* Model from an existing igert: people from different depts working on solving enviro problems. First year: seminars on issues relating to international institutional research. Had side projects with people in Canada (but nothing came from the side projects). Had to go abroad in second year. Seminars were effective in cohort building.
* Logic model: sustain, audience
* Could work with TVA, the park for environmental goals.
* What can we do that's not already being done in Forest, Wildlife, and Fisheries (we could absorb them into this grant).
* Training in FWF is different from EEB. We want people who can be leaders of the direction.
* Introduce novel technologies vs retro (classic) knowledge.
* Maybe crossing scales should be an emphasis. Not just pop bio of particular species (as in FWF): also communities, pop gen.
* From genomes to biomes: generating next gen taxonomists. Integrate scales and taxonomy, also mechanisms.
* Make sure to emphasize non-academic track as a goal.
* Internship as a component.
* Joe Clark part of USGS would be good contact: what people need to know: leadership, project management, in addition to bio.
* Taxonomy: do by biome: taxonomy of fish, mussels, and other freshwater things; teach skills in dichotomous keys.
* Train in one subspecialty (fieldwork, recognize biodiversity in the field). Learn same concepts, but with a specialty.
* include training in genetics, eDNA, barcoding, multiplexing: important for community ecology, systematics.
* Training in spatial skills. LiDAR to understand biodiversity on the ground, drones.
* Training in decisions you'll need to make in a career (management, etc.). Need project management training, social science.
* Maybe talk to business school about management training
* Have the students connect to each other: some way to have them interact. Partner.
* Outreach to agencies, Tremont or other educational groups.
* How to get buy in from faculty. Why encourage students to go intern for a semester, rather than work on your lab's core stuff? How to demonstrate this to NSF.
* Need a feeling for the organism. Contact with them.
* Two tracks or one track? The skills could apply to everybody. Group seems to agree on one track that leads to many outcomes.


## Training
* Statistics
* Natural history
* Project dev

## Agreed

* Next gen biodiversity researchers (not just taxonomists)
* Internships
* Meeting to invite outside agencies / groups to ask them what they need in people to hire.
* Two week field courses
* Need to instill feeling for the organism.

## Action items

* Summarize material & submit to research office: **Brian**
* Talk to Sharon Pound with ORE
