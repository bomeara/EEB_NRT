Brief (2 -3 paragraphs) explanation of proposed research or program:

The US faces a key need for next generation biodiversity researchers. For understanding emerging infectious diseases, detecting and stopping invasive species, managing resources such as fish stocks, and understanding how to conserve biodiversity in the face of anthropogenic change we need biologists trained in a wide array of skills (Tewksbury et al. 2014). However, our training efforts often result in a relative handful of researchers with deep taxonomic and evolutionary knowledge of one group but little training in how to apply it, or workers trained in details of resource management but without sufficient depth of knowledge of evolutionary or ecological contexts. Regardless of training path, many graduates lack skills in the latest technology revolutionizing fields, ranging from next generation sequencing abilities allowing detection of organisms from wisps of DNA in a stream or sequencing entire viral genomes in a day, drones allowing remote sensing of biodiversity data, and geographic information systems to allow precise mapping and correlation of abiotic factors with responses of organisms. Moreover, none of our training of potential leaders in this area covers necessary skills such as project management.

Our strategy to remedy this is a new program that capitalizes on the University of Tennessee's academic expertise while also engaging with local and national partners. The program covers three modular areas: 1) core biology training: areas such as ecology, evolution, genetics, and especially natural history; 2) technological training: remote sensing, genomics, GIS; 3) vocational training: project management, assessment. The core biology training builds on existing courses but will also feature two week intense field courses. The technological training will largely be delivered in workshops. Our faculty already offer a few workshops that can draw interest from hundreds of applicants; by streaming these online, we can reach many more trainees than the core set of students supported by the program. Tutorials and field courses also offer a mechanism for long term sustainability of this initiative through participant fees. For vocational training we will partner with the Haslam School of Business to offer relevant courses in project management and team building. Trainees will also participate in at least one internship with our partners, which will help build their professional networks and expose them to concrete issues. Throughout the life of the grant, integration with our external partners will help us tailor training to meet key needs they identify.

UT Knoxville is the ideal location to establish such a program. For biodiversity experts, we are already a key destination given our high biodiversity and existing groundwork to map it (such as the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory, which has mapped 19,000 species in Great Smoky Mountains National Park), and our faculty already teach key courses about fish, fungi, plants, reptiles, amphibians, and spiders. We have a tradition of collaboration with, and placement of graduates in, outside groups such as The Nature Conservancy and the Tennessee Clean Water Network. Our technological skills are at the cutting edge, with expertise in environmental DNA monitoring, high performance computing, next generation sequencing, and use of drone and satellite imagery for addressing biological questions.
