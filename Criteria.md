Info on goals and criteria from NSF. Emphasis added.

* Catalyze and advance cutting-edge **interdisciplinary research** in high priority areas
* Increase the capacity of U.S. graduate programs to produce interdisciplinary STEM professionals with technical and transferable professional skills for a range of research and research-related **careers within and outside academia**
* Develop innovative approaches and knowledge that will promote **transformative improvements in graduate education**.
* Creation of sustainable programmatic capacity at institutions is an expected outcome. Proposals, accordingly, should describe mechanisms to institutionalize effective training elements after award closure.
* NRT is intended to benefit a population of STEM graduate students larger than just those who receive an NRT stipend; NRT trainees do not have to receive NRT stipend or tuition support. An **NRT trainee, accordingly, is defined as a STEM graduate student, irrespective of funding source, who is accepted into an institution’s NRT program and completes the required NRT elements (e.g., courses, workshops, projects, and other training activities specific to the NRT experience) set by the program**. To further maximize the number of students benefiting from NRT activities, **proposers are expected to make available (within the capacity and budget limitations of the award) NRT program elements to other STEM graduate students who are not NRT trainees**.
* NRT trainees must be master’s and/or doctoral STEM students in a research-based degree program that requires a thesis or dissertation. If an institution’s NRT program includes both master’s and doctoral students, the proposal should identify any differences in NRT program requirements, as well as mechanisms to foster the development of a collective NRT graduate student community.
* Priority research areas:
  * Understanding the Brain
  * Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems
  * Any other interdisciplinary research theme of national priority


Key questions (from http://www.nsf.gov/attachments/134466/public/NRT_Webinar-Traineeshiptrack.pdf):
* What is the evidence for the training approaches and models that you plan to include in your comprehensive traineeship?
* How does the proposed project complement or build on other ongoing or prior institutional efforts to improve graduate education?
* How will the training program be of broad benefit to graduate students beyond the NRT trainees at your institution?
* Does the project include collaborations with the private sector, ngos, government agencies, national labs, field stations, museums and others that add value to the proposed research and training program?
* What types of data will you collect to evaluate the training program? What plans will you develop to disseminate lessons learned from program, both within the institutions involved and with others across the nation who are interested in graduate education?
* And finally, have you included plans and a strategy for institutionalizing successful elements of the program? How will these elements be sustained?

Questions reviewers will be asked  (from http://www.nsf.gov/attachments/134466/public/NRT_Webinar-Traineeshiptrack.pdf):
* Does the proposal address training needs that are not currently available and are there clear and compelling connections between the training elements and the interdisciplinary research theme?
* What is the degree of interdisciplinarityand the potential for high impact synergies among the disciplines?
* What is the breadth and quality of the plan to provide NRT trainees with professional development training for a range of research and research-related career pathways within and outside academia?
* What is the quality of the recruiting and mentoring plans to broaden participation?
* Does the evaluation plan include outcomes, performance measures, benchmarks, and an evaluation timetable? Also, does the proposal describe how formative evaluation will improve practice?
