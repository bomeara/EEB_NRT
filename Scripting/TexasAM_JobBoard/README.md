This is a script to pull data from the Texas A&M Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences Job Board (http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/). Our goal for this is to establish employer need for the skills coming from the training in this grant. We're thus getting the job descriptions, qualifications, etc. The script is written to gently scrape their server (waiting an average of 10 seconds between calls, not downloading jobs already saved). The output is saved as a dataframe in jobs.rda.
