The great benefit of methods such as camera traps and/or hair snares is that, despite studies typically being designed with a single species of interest in mind, usually a species of conservation or management concern, they simultaneously detect multiple species that exist on the landscape.  Indeed, the single-species approach to tackling ecological, conservation and management issues may not be a sustainable model given the global biodiversity crisis.
In response to an increasing shift towards a multi-species perspective of ecological systems, this PhD will broadly examine for following issues related to two popular classes of hierarchical models – occupancy models, and spatial capture-recapture models:
1.	How reliable are inferences about ‘monitoring by-catch’ species using studies designed for a single species?
2.	What is the optimal multi-species study design that balances the trade-off between achieving inference objectives on priority species and understanding the wider community?","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","09/11/2016","We are looking for applicants that have an interest in both applied and quantitative ecology.

The monkey sanctuary which is situated next to the elephant sanctuary, provides a safe haven for monkeys that are abandoned by their owners or monkeys that are confiscated by customs. The monkeys do not return to the amazon, but spend the rest of their lives in this sanctuary where they can live freely.Monkeys are not locked up in cages but stay in an area of a couple of hectares where they can roam freely. Again they have made the sanctuary available to tourists and use the income to cover the costs. 

Last, but definitely not least, the cheetah and wild dog centre. They are focused on breeding rare and endangered species: cheetah and African wild dog and support scientific investigations into all aspects of these species.

The program runs in the Balule Game Reserve which is adjacent to the Kruger National Park. Trips to the Kruger Park will be made on a regular basis, morning and afternoon bush walks and sunset- sundowner and night! drives are a daily part of the program. You will also gain practical experience in the Bush, which could include alien plant control, erosion management or maintaining roads, etc. 

You will receive some lectures during your stay, but cannot be compared to the lectures that you have in college. The lectures take place on the first floor of the lookout tower! No windows, no doors, going back to basic! The information given during the lectures will be put into practice during the bush walks, drives and the other practical experiences. 

The program is designed to bring the student/volunteer in close contact with nature, wildlife and conservation, encourage eco-friendly utilization of South Africa’s nature and wildlife resources, point out ways and methods to generate revenue to be re-invested in conservation and preservation. 

You will gain practical and theoretical experience on reptiles, birds, mammals and animal behaviour. 

What else? A trip to the Kruger National Park - a two-day, overnight stay in the world-famous park! Two full days in Kruger, covering some 600kms from Orpen to Skukuza where you will camp (subject to availability) overnight, sitting by the camp fence enjoying their braai (bbq) dinner as the hyaenas patrol close-by on the other side! An early start on day two will take you far south in the park and across from west-to-east before heading back north-and-west to exit at Orpen. We cover all kinds of eco-systems – open savannahs, riverine areas, bushveld scrub – and needless to say, sightings are generally plentiful and often phenomenal! 
• A half-day Reptile Ranger Course: Anyone can walk through the Reptile Park and leave with a few nice photos, but what else? They take you to do the educational and interactive 4-hour Field Guide Course! After a power-point introduction, the Park Curator will show you around. There are all kinds of snakes as well as crocodiles, bearded dragons, iguanas, monitor lizards, scorpions and spiders. You can feed the plated lizards & a chameleon; and then watch as a snake is fed. In a live demonstration, the Curator will teach you about snake behaviour, fang structure and venom types using a Puff Adder, Boomslang and Snouted Cobra. You will also have the chance to hold a Golden Baboon Spider, a protected spider of the region! Scared of snakes and spiders? You won’t be after this course: respect, not fear! 
• Full day Blyde Canyon mountain hike: a leisurely day in the beautiful mountains with natural streams and waterfalls. Plenty of areas in which to dive in and swim in nature’s natural pools. In the fresh, unpolluted air doesn’t take your breath away the natural scenery will! 
• The Poaching Crisis – what can we do?: a powerful and passionate educational day concerning the issues our country faces with poaching: Hunting vs Poaching - what is the difference?, and Crime Scene management – a sad indictment of the times we live in as trainee guides are now taught how to manage a crime (poaching) scene 
• A half-day wildlife rehabilitation centre tour: a haven for the care of abandoned, injured and poisoned wildlife. Wildlife is brought to the centre from all corners of South Africa, and, once healthy enough, are re-introduced into their natural environments. Those creatures which cannot be returned to the wild due to the nature and extent of their injuries are cared for at the centre and are used to educate the many people who visit each year, both from across South Africa and abroad. The tour includes cheetah, lions, leopard, hyaena, every kind of eagle, Ground Hornbill, caracal, serval, honey badger and the chance to feed vultures! 

We also endeavour to introduce community work in to the programme where we can as we forge ties with the Green Kidz Initiative – an education-driven project that introduces local children to the value of wildlife & nature - and Nourish, a passion-driven initiative to uplift local communities through satellite farming projects, maintaining infrastructure for crèches, toy libraries, etc. 

You’ll wonder how we can also fit in a trip to the Glencoe baobab, the second largest baobab in South Africa which has been carbon-dated to be almost 3,000 years old. In its prime, this baobab stood with a diameter of 15.9 m (52 ft) with a circumference of 47 m (154 ft) and at a height of 17 m (56 ft), and the spread of crown 37.05 m (121.6 ft).

Qualifications
No specific qualifications are required to volunteer and experience with animals is not required. A genuine interest for the animal’s welfare, enjoyment of wildlife and the outdoors is all you need. Due to the nature of the facility most of the animals are adults and the work is not hands on. Our minimum age requirement is 18 years of age. The project however caters for a variety of ages and includes not only students, but also people taking a career break or looking for a more meaningful holiday so that also includes a more mature traveller. If you are travelling in a group or with family we do try accommodate teenage children 17 years accompanied by a parent. An average physical fitness and willingness to get ones hands dirty is required Welgedacht is made up of 1200ha of natural bush with varying terrain. Many of the daily tasks are done on foot covering large areas. Most of the duties are physical and not all are fun to do. The running of a sanctuary and greater game reserve of this size is 90% hard work and 10% fun. We ask you to please carefully read the duties and expectations of a volunteer so that you are prepared before you arrive for what to expect.

If you need to perform field research for your thesis involving elephants, you can do your research in South Africa! 

Their overall research programme within GLTP represents a long-term study focused on understanding what motivates elephant movements from core conservation areas such as the Kruger National Park (KNP) into peripheral Protected Areas along its western, eastern and northern borders.

Objective 1 – They track elephant movements using advanced GPS and GMS technology in order to understand their habitat use. By identifying specific elephants, we study population dynamics and objectives relating to the drivers of elephant movements.

Objective 1&2 – They identify, track and monitor large-tusked and potentially large-tusked individuals to record their movements and fitness, in terms of annual musth cycles. In doing so, we are offering them a measure of protection. We have deployed a number of collars on large-tusked bulls, some of which have gained public support and recognition.

Objective 3&4 – They provide information on the effects of elephants as drivers of ecosystem change in relation to indicator species such as large trees (primary) and selected tree nesting birds (secondary). Individual trees are monitored over time to establish rates of change in important landscape features.

Objective 5 – They experiment with methods of alleviating the impact that elephants have on trees by wire-netting large trees or using beehives as natural deterrents, thus increasing food security for other species including humans. This information contributes towards improving our knowledge of the ecological processes that promote the sustainable coexistence of elephants, their habitats and people.

Objective 6 – They monitor and compare elephant mortality rates and causes thereof within the continental context. The southern states (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) have become the last stronghold for the African elephant due to uncontrolled poaching to the north of these borders.

Objective 6 – They initiate research projects as well as collaborate with established research sites across the southern states to deepen our understanding on how different land-use practises influence the movements, survival and the conservation significance of elephants.

Working Wetlands Conservation Delivery Coordinator

POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

LOCATION: Specific location within SONEC to be determined.

APPOINTMENT: Minimum three years, full time.

BACKGROUND:

The SONEC Working Wetlands Conservation Delivery Coordinator position serves to support strategic, partner-driven conservation of working wet meadows in Southern Oregon-Northeastern California (SONEC) through the SONEC Working Wet Meadows Initiative. Supporting 4.9 million waterfowl during spring migration, SONEC is one of the most important staging areas for waterfowl in North America and also serves as a critical migration stopover and breeding area for waterfowl, shorebirds, and waterbirds. Private landowners that manage wet meadows to produce forage for livestock as part of their working ranches play a key role in sustaining Pacific Flyway migratory bird populations. Many of these wet meadows occur in historic floodplains and are managed through flood-irrigation to achieve agricultural objectives and mimic natural hydrological processes. As such, this position is highly focused on bridging wildlife and agricultural conservation objectives on working private lands. The position builds, strengthens, and connects science, field delivery, communications, and partnership capacity for working lands conservation.

JOIN THE TEAM!

We are seeking a Working Wetlands Conservation Delivery Coordinator to lead and oversee working wetland habitat delivery activities across SONEC. This position is supported through a collaborative funding arrangement of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program (PFW), and the Intermountain West Joint Venture (IWJV) to accelerate working wetlands conservation in SONEC. Hosted by the Wildlife Management Institute (WMI), the position will be based in the SONEC landscape and report to IWJV senior staff and an oversight team of contributing partners. The position will work closely with an interdisciplinary team of staff members and partners including, but not limited to, the IWJV Coordinator, IWJV Science Coordinator, IWJV Spatial Ecologist, Ducks Unlimited (DU) Regional Biologist, NRCS Basin Team Leaders, NRCS Field Office staff, FWS PFW Biologists, WMI Western Region Field Representative, and state conservation partners. The position is intended to accelerate conservation of working wetland habitats, enhance collaboration among partners, access and leverage habitat conservation funding, assist partner biologists with program delivery, and improve communication among conservation partners in the SONEC landscape.

Housing will be provided within the park, along with per diem of $34/day. Positions will run from October 1st through approx. December 20th.

The project uses a Before-After, Control-Impact study design to investigate the effects of removing three invasive predator species (black rat, western yellow jacket, and Argentine ant) on the Hawaii ‘elepaio, an endemic flycatcher, and native arthropods. Our four field plots (each 700x700m) are located in mesic montane forest on the slopes of Mauna Loa. Up to three episodes of live trapping and ear tagging rats will take place beginning this fall to establish pre-treatment rat population estimates. 

Following this capture-recapture component, rats will be removed from treatment plots using rodenticide in bait stations. Pesticides will also be used to remove yellow jackets and ants. We will be operating video cameras to capture rat behavior, as well as using tracking tunnels and chew blocks to determine effectiveness of treatments. 

Radio collars will also be used on rats to track movements and observe behavior/habitat use at night with the assistance of telemetry equipment and night vision goggles. We will monitor arthropod populations using a variety of methods, including malaise traps, branch clipping, baits and baited traps, and yellow pan traps.

Volunteers will be expected to hike several miles per day, sometimes with 30+ lbs of equipment (including heavy batteries for surveillance cameras). Must be in good physical condition, be able and willing to work long days in the field, and in all weather. The weather is highly variable from cold/cool/rainy/windy to hot/ dry and can change quickly. The field sites are located within a 10-45 minute drive of our office between 4000 and 6000 ft elevation on rough, uneven terrain with dense vegetation.
Job responsibilities:
• Live-trap and ear tag rats, identify animal tracks on tracking tunnel ink cards, and evaluate chew block consumption to estimate rat population abundance and activity on treatment and non-treatment plots before and after rat removal.
• Track rats using radio-telemetry, at times overnight, to observe behavior and habitat use.
• Remove rats from two treatment plots using rodenticide (bait blocks secured within 450 bait stations).
• Deploy and maintain pesticide bait stations to remove yellow jackets from two treatment plots.
• Distribute granular pesticide by hand to remove ants from one treatment plot.
• Trap and collect arthropods using a variety of techniques to monitor abundances of forest arthropods.
• Process arthropod samples in the lab.
• Enter data into Microsoft Excel and Access databases.
• Drive 4x4 vehicles (on pavement only).
• Navigate within sites using GPS, maps and compass.
• Set up and maintenance of wildlife monitoring cameras throughout field sites.
• Occasional bird related activities, including resighting color-banded birds, mist-netting, banding, and nest searching for the Hawaii ‘elepaio.

Most equipment will be provided (eg notebooks, gps units, radios, binoculars), you must supply your own hiking boots, backpacks, field clothes and rain gear. Weekly transportation to Hilo (30 miles from park volunteer house and office) will be provided for groceries/supplies.

Balsam Mountain Trust, located in Sylva, NC,  is hiring an Educational Outreach Coordinator (EOC) for a 10 month AmeriCorps position starting in October 2016. The Education Outreach Coordinator (EOC) will develop and implement school and public programs.  In our two target counties, the vast majority of schools are designated Title 1, with many unable to afford outreach programming.

The EOC will also work to continue development and growth of the pollinator program initiated by our previous members. This program aims to engage the public in pollinator conservation (using monarch butterflies as a target species) through participation in hands-on activities and citizen science. Programming is currently delivered to elementary school students, local libraries, and our Hispanic community; the EOC will have the opportunity to discover new partnerships to expand the reach of this program.

Presumptions have been that HSB behave ecologically like Striped Bass and there is little competition between black bass and HSB. Stocking of HSB created an additional fishery for Arkansas’ anglers.  HSB have historically been thought to utilize forage generally unavailable to black basses, and not influence the quality of black bass fisheries in those systems. Annually, 63,000 anglers fish 426,000 days for moronids in Arkansas. Recent results of an age and growth study of HSB in DeGray Lake, AR indicated that much of the population is comprised of older, slow growing individuals. This project will examine management strategies to maximize the quality of the Hybrid Striped Bass fisheries in large reservoirs, without negatively affecting black bass populations or fisheries.","Pine Bluff, AR","11/01/2016","M.S. degree in fisheries, natural resources conservation, or a related field, minimum GPA of 3.0, and GRE score (verbal + quantitative) of 1,000+  (for GRE exams prior to Nov 1, 2011) or 297+ (for GRE exams after Nov 1, 2011) are required.

At peak numbers, the Refuges also hold more wintering ducks than any location in western Oregon south of the Columbia River.  The Refuges support some of the largest and most ecologically significant blocks of native habitat in the Willamette Valley.  Visitors to the Refuges frequently view herds of Roosevelt elk, bobcats, a variety of bird species, and they enjoy a diverse number of habitats in which to hike and observe wildlife: oak savanna, wet prairie, upland prairie, riparian corridors, emergent and deep water marshes, and Douglas fir forests.

Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located at the northern end of the Florida Keys near Key Largo, Florida. The Lower Florida Keys Refuges are physically separated from Crocodile Lake NWR. This group of three refuges, National Key Deer Refuge, Key West National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), and Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), is situated between the city of Marathon and the Marquesas Keys, which are located west of Key West, Florida.

The National Key Deer Refuge was established in 1957 to protect and preserve Key deer and other wildlife resources in the Florida Keys. The refuge is located in the lower Florida Keys and currently consists of approximately 9,200 acres of land that includes pine rockland forests, tropical hardwood hammocks, freshwater wetlands, salt marsh wetlands, and mangrove forests. These natural communities are critical habitat for hundreds of endemic and migratory species including 17 federally-listed species such as Key deer, lower Keys marsh rabbit, eastern indigo snake, Stock Island tree snail and silver rice rat.

Closing Date: August 25, 2016 at 9pm PT
Group Definition:  Fisheries Technicians perform duties related to the protection, preservation, or propagation of fish species and the preservation or enhancement of species habitat.  They use knowledge of procedural requirements and processes to support the technical work of their unit.  They provide practical technical support to research, operations, or program administration efforts.
Project Specifics:  The NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) will collaborate on the use of acoustical and optical imaging systems to study the effects of mobile optical and acoustic survey platforms in deep water (100-200m).  Imaging will be conducted from fixed landers on the seafloor equipped with digital still stereo cameras and ultrasonic imaging sonars (e.g., DIDSON).  The PSMFC will provide support and coordination through all phases of the research including planning, data analysis (with articular emphasis on analysis of large acoustical and optical data sets), and writing of reports and papers.  An example of the type of required analysis is to match sampling volumes between stereo camera systems and imaging sonars and the survey platforms to calculate optical ""catchability"" of fishes, and to measure swimming speeds and trajectories.  The information and insights obtained through this research collaboration will inform the interpretation and use of past and future data on the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes acquired through in situ direct count surveys.
Position Specifics:  The work for this position will be split between the  Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Newport, OR and their Seattle, WA location on Montlake Blvd.  Additionally the incumbent will be traveling to do some field work off the coast of southern California.  Successful candidate should have experience collecting acoustics data (familiarity with sonar systems and computer networking issues and troubleshooting).

Supervisory Controls:  
Work is assigned on a daily or weekly basis in terms of project objectives, individual objective, and basic priorities.  The employee plans and carries out the assignment with independence, following established protocol.  He/she seeks assistance only as needed.  When common technical and procedural problems arise, the employee exercises initiative in developing solutions. Accuracy of the data produced, quality of the observations made, and sufficiency of planning and execution are normally accepted without detailed review.
Reviews are utilized to ensure that the employee works effectively and produces high quality end products. 
Guidelines:
Guides may be regulations, maps and charts, sampling and survey methodologies, standing operating procedures, emergency response protocols, oral instructions, equipment or instrument manuals, hardware/software manuals, and/or fish identification keys.  
The guides often require careful study or cross-referencing to locate the applicable rule or answer and can involve some interpretation or judgment to resolve the issue.  
Complexity:
The employee is expected to select and execute the proper approach to completing the work.  The assigned duties often have steps or processes which vary, depending on factors such as the reason the work is being performed or the conditions under which it is being performed.  The employee is expected to exercise independence in recognizing such differences, in choosing the right course of action, and then in selecting and executing the proper approach to completing the work.
Leaders at the lower end of the range typically lead the work of fewer than three employees and are responsible for the common Lead tasks such as: distributing and balancing work, keeping in touch with work progress, estimating completion of work, instructing employees in specific tasks and techniques, answering questions on procedures or problems that arise, approving leave for a few hours or for emergencies, and reporting on performance and behavior issues.
Leaders at the higher end of the range typically lead the work of three or more workers.  Importantly, assignments at the higher end of the range are made more complex because of responsibility for leading non-PSMFC employees (i.e., state employees, workers under special employment programs) and because of significant responsibility for establishing work schedules and for managing equipment logistics for the group.
Scope and Effect: 
Work products directly affect the design and execution of experiments, the operation of systems, or the adequacy of long range investigations, tests, or research conclusions.
Personal Contacts:  
Contacts are with employees in PSMFC; federal, state, or local fishery agencies; visiting scientists; fishing industry representatives, the general public; and contractor personnel. 
Purpose of Contacts:  
The purpose of contacts is to exchange information and insure that project goals are being met through coordination and planning.  Communication between contacts affords resolution of problematic issues and serves as an information network.
Physical Demands:
Demands can range from moderate-including walking, climbing stairs and ladders, reaching, lifting, bending, and strenuous sweeping-to rigorous.  In the latter case, the employee must be able to handle buckets of water or gear weighing up to 50 pounds.  Long daily periods of hiking, carrying equipment, swimming, and/or standing may be required.  Living at sea in vessels with minimal amenities for extended periods may be required. 
Work Environment:
The majority of the work is performed in an office setting with adequate lighting, heating and ventilation.  A portion of the work is in the field.  Incumbents may work on narrow, elevated walkways and platforms that are over or adjacent to water.  Field work involves exposure to all types of weather.  Work aboard boats, research vessels, or commercial fishing vessels may be required.","Newport, Oregon (97365)","08/25/2016","Minimum Qualification Requirements:

This includes accommodation, 3 meals a day, participation in the entire program. 

The program is a volunteer program, but accommodates both students and volunteers. 

The program is divided into three main sections: Participation, Conservation and Sight Seeing. 

The focus of the program is on the cheetah, and during the course participants are involved with the everyday care of the cheetahs. This includes, cleaning, feeding, and where required, assisting with or observing any veterinary activities that may occur during their stay. The same activities apply to other species being cared for at the centre. The knowledge gained about the animals and work of the centre through this kind of participation is both specific and personal. 

The Sight Seeing section of the program is where participants get to put theory into practice either through directed observation in the wild or at other centres that specialise in other areas of research or conservation. 

The program is largely based on the interactive involvement of participants, who in the process gain valuable knowledge of and experience in nature conservation. 

During this time participants may see and be involved in some of the following: 
Darting of wildlife and possible translocations. 
Tranquilization of a cheetah for health examinations and possible sampling of blood and other tissues to check for various disease statuses. 
Tuberculosis testing in wildlife. 
Lectures of darting equipment, drugs and their safety (subject to the current activities at the centre at time of travel) 
Procedures requiring an external veterinary specialist 
Hand rearing (previously an elephant, white rhinos, zebra and many tiny creatures have been hand reared in the past). 
Wildlife casualties. 
Post-­‐mortems (subject to the current activities at the centre at time of travel) 
Collection of samples for genetics, blood parasite studies and ticks (subject to the current activities at the centre at time of travel) 
Work with exotic species such as frogs, snakes, birds and any cases that do happen to come into the centre. 
Work together with the curators and the animals. 
EXPERIENCE

"291","http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/jobs/wildlife-rehabilitation-internship-california/","International Bird Rescue","Internships","The internship program at International Bird Rescue is a rigorous, hands-on learning program that immerses participants in every aspect of the operations of an aquatic bird hospital. The intensely rigorous nature of wildlife rehabilitation requires many of the same skills that are required in an oil spill, and interns who are able to adjust to the pace and volume of the peak season caseload have an advantage in adapting successfully to working in an oil spill response. Each hospital is staffed daily with at least two experienced Rehabilitation Technicians who oversee case management and facilitate the learning processes of interns and volunteers. Although interns will sometimes interact with the staff veterinarian, this is a rehabilitation, not a veterinary, internship. Interns in the rehabilitation program generally volunteer for 3-6 months of time while living on-site at one of the two centers.

Most common aquatic bird patients: herons, and egrets; waterfowl; shorebirds; loons and grebes; murres and other alcids; gulls, pelicans and cormorants; and the occasional tubenose.

The Los Angeles facility is located on a scenic bluff overlooking the ocean in San Pedro, CA (Los Angeles County). The LA center has a consistent influx of animals year round, with the busiest seasons often occurring in the summer and winter months. Summers feature large numbers of Brown Pelicans, while winters feature birds oiled from natural oil seeps off the southern California coast.

The San Francisco Bay facility is located in Fairfield, CA, approximately 1 hour northeast of San Francisco, on the edge of Suisun Marsh, one of the largest wetland ecosystems in the world. Spring and summer are the busiest seasons because of a large influx of aquatic baby birds. Generally, the SF Bay center raises >300 Heron and Egret chicks, >1,200 Ducklings, as well as dozens of shore birds and a variable number of fledgling Brown Pelicans.

Building on the historic 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement ratified by 195 nations, Turtle Island has launched the 10,000 Redwoods Project, which provides an innovative way for individuals, schools and businesses to directly engage in the climate change challenge through the simple act of planting trees to sequester carbon.

Redwood trees store more carbon per hectare than any other tree on Earth. Coastal redwood trees sequester triple the above ground carbon of any other type of tree, making them a key player in mitigating climate change. We know carbon is stored in redwood trunks, but amazingly soils and roots store even more!

Due to overharvesting, only five percent of the original old-growth coast redwood trees remain, and they are listed as “endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The loss of coastal redwoods in California also impacts critically endangered coho salmon and other species.

The fact that redwoods are fast growing, massive, long-lived, rot resistant, easy to cultivate, and awe-inspiring, make them the ideal icon for action on climate change.

The 10,000 Redwood Project was developed to support our project restoring endangered coho salmon in northern California, called SPAWN:

The goal of the project is to better define range capacity for recovery units of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep to yield estimates of potential population size from a bottom-up perspective based on available resources. Although subject to modification, the anticipated approach will be integrative and follow four key steps: 1) reclassify alpine habitat on a fine spatial resolution to provide better estimates of available forage; 2) create new models of habitat selection based on reclassified habitat and as a function of migration status; 3) evaluate nutritional underpinning of demographics and nutritional status of populations; 4) couple the results of steps 1–3 to identify capacity of recovery units to support bighorn sheep to ultimately yield an estimate of potential population size.  This effort will fill an important gap in our understanding of the species biology, producing publishable scientific results of immediate relevance to managers. Improving our understanding of the potential for growth in extant and extirpated Sierra bighorn herds will provide managers with a rigorous biological basis for prioritizing future management efforts and recovery goals for this species.

"342","http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/jobs/director-conservation-ranching-program-missouri/","Audubon","Full time Positions","Overview:

Now in its second century, Audubon is dedicated to protecting birds and other wildlife and the habitat that supports them. Audubon’s mission is engaging people in bird conservation on a hemispheric scale through science, policy, education and on-the-ground conservation action.  By mobilizing and aligning its network of Chapters, Centers, State and Important Bird Area programs in the four major migratory flyways in the Americas, the organization will bring the full power of Audubon to bear on protecting common and threatened bird species and the critical habitat they need to survive.  And as part of BirdLife International, Audubon will join people in over 100 in-country organizations all working to protect a network of Important Bird Areas around the world, leveraging the impact of actions they take at a local level.  What defines Audubon’s unique value is a powerful grassroots network of nearly 500 local chapters, 22 state offices, 41 Audubon Centers, Important Bird Area Programs in 50 states, and 700 staff across the country. Audubon is a federal contractor and an Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE).
 

 
Among the most endangered ecosystems in North America are the once immense grasslands that span from Canada, through the heartland of the United States, and into northern and central Mexico. Across North America, Audubon is working with ranchers and landowners to protect the habitat grassland birds need to survive. More than 50 percent of North America’s vast native grasslands, an area that once covered roughly 585 million acres, has been developed or converted to other uses over the past century. As a result, bird species that rely on this habitat are among those in sharpest decline.
 
To protect these iconic American birds, Audubon has established the Conservation Ranching Program to work with private and public partners to create market-based solutions that help ranchers manage their land in ways that preserve natural grasslands. Audubon has developed relatively easy-to-implement land management protocols that improve habitat, while creating opportunities for ranchers to reach new and growing markets for their products. Public partners and private sector experts have been enlisted to help spread and encourage these practices, and we are now in the process of developing a marketing and certification program that will enable participating ranches to market their products as bird-friendly. Because the majority of grassland habitat is in private hands, we will have the greatest impact if we work collaboratively with individuals, families, businesses and consumers to identify the most effective ways to protect birds and wildlife.
 
Audubon is creating a “bird-friendly” certification using the Audubon brand that can be used by those who voluntarily implement land management protocols on their ranches. This “Good Housekeeping” seal of approval with the trusted Audubon brand will expand marketing opportunities for participating ranchers and help to attract buyers in a market that is expanding exponentially. In fact, over the last 15 years, the market for certified sustainable products has grown from $5 million to $2 billion. Market analysts project that this segment will grow to $15 to $20 billion in the next decade. If you add the fact that there are more than 46 million birders in the U.S. alone, the opportunities to generate premiums for products that display the Audubon logo and that support bird-friendly habitats is sizeable.
 
Audubon is advancing this market-based approach by:
Refining land management protocols that sustain native grasslands and the birds that depend on them. 
Supporting private landowners and working with suppliers and retailers to establish a path to market for certified agricultural products, primarily beef. 
Leveraging Audubon’s stellar brand to drive consumers toward certified bird-friendly products.
Measuring success with ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the ecological and biological response to our bird-friendly land management protocols as a condition for certification.
Position Summary:

The Director of the Conservation Ranching Program works with national, flyway and state leadership to coordinate and oversee Audubon’s Conservation Ranching program nationally. This position also works directly with conservation and education staff in participating states to coordinate local implementation, program management, and outreach. S/he is responsible for oversight and support of the development and implementation of conservation ranching protocols in all participating landscapes; management of selected certification partners and program advisors; coordination of agreements and relationships with state and federal agency partners; coordination of partnerships with peer organizations and NGOs; coordination of supply-chain and retail/market-side partnerships; oversight and support of monitoring and evaluation requirements of the program; and coordination with National Audubon science, marketing, legal, and finance teams. The Conservation Ranching Program Director is expected to actively participate and support the marketing and development needs of this program. This includes assisting to prepare funding proposals and applications, meeting with program donors and supporters when needed, and establishing an appropriate marketing and communications plan coordinated with National Audubon communications teams.
 
This position will be a direct report to Audubon’s Central Flyway Vice President.
Essential Functions:

Develop and maintain a detailed working understanding of Audubon’s overall North American grassland strategy and the unique role played by the Conservation Ranching Program. 
Develop and maintain procedural standardization of the program amongst all implementation partners, internal and external to Audubon.
Develop, manage and revise as needed Audubon’s library of conservation ranching protocols pertinent to each of the ecoregions in which the program is operating.
Oversee the development and management of a certification program that includes third-party partners and program advisors that perform duties for Audubon within the United States; coordinate with certifiers and advisors that may be working with Audubon’s international conservation partners in Canada, Mexico, and South America.
Coordinate and manage agreements and relationships with state and federal agency partners.
Coordinate and manage partnerships with peer conservation organizations and program stakeholders.
Coordinate the development and management of supply-chain and retail/market-side partnerships throughout the United States in a manner that protects the integrity of the program.

The primary mission is to continue working towards eradication of the Yellow Crazy Ant (YCA), Anoplolepis gracilipes. Johnston Atoll is located in the central Pacific Ocean, 717 nautical miles west-southwest of Honolulu, and is uninhabited, except for the four volunteers and one crew leader. Volunteers will have the rare opportunity to live in this remote setting surrounded by abundant birds and sea life. 
Duties and Responsibilities: 
Volunteers will be expected to work at least 48 hours/week, 6 days/week for their 6 months on island. Some projects will require working evenings or consecutive days, including weekends. An additional month will be spent in Honolulu, HI where volunteers will pack and prepare gear, food, and all items necessary for field camp. 
While on Johnston Island, responsibilities include: 
•	Ant monitoring and pesticide application. 
•	Entomological surveys. 
•	Seabird, shorebird, and sea turtle surveys 
•	Data collection and management 
•	Weekly and summary reporting 
•	Camp maintenance and chores 
Special Considerations: Johnston is an extremely remote site, where all but emergency access is by ship, which takes 3-5 days from Honolulu. No re-supply or ship visits during the 6-month camp are anticipated. On the island, transportation will primarily be by foot or bicycle with 1-mile daily commutes to the work site. Living conditions are primitive and consist of 10’x14’x6’ personal sleeping tents and a bunker is used for communal/food storage/kitchen and office areas. Weather conditions can be harsh with strong winds, tropical storms, and hot sun. Bathing and washing are done with salt water. Communication with the island has proven to be reliable but is limited to slow internet access and a satellite phone. Internet access is not guaranteed and team members must be prepared for the possibility of communication being limited to e-mail via the satellite phone with no internet browsing capability. Direct medical attention is a minimum of 1-3 days away. As such, safety is of primary concern.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will provide: airfare to and from Honolulu, housing and a modest food stipend while in Honolulu, transportation between Honolulu and Johnston, clothes for use on island, and food and housing on Johnston. The Honolulu stipend will not be paid up front so volunteers will need to have sufficient finances to provide for their own food during the one-month preparation period in Honolulu.","Johnston Atoll NWR / Honolulu, HI","08/26/2016","Requirements: 
Volunteers must be willing and able to work 48 hours per week.

Strong, healthy bodies are critical. Must be able to perform all duties in various weather conditions including high heat and humidity, strong winds, and rain. Must be able to work well independently as well as closely in a small group, be easy-going with a good sense of humor, and flexible to changing conditions. All CAST members must follow rigorous pesticide and safety protocols. Qualified applicants must possess a valid passport that will not expire before November 2017. Possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license is preferred.

By working at the interface of science and application, the Conservation Science program generates, integrates, and applies the best science to real-world problems, shares knowledge and effective tools with practitioners, decision-makers, and partners, and builds capacity in partner organizations and future conservation leaders.   

This Conservation Support GIS/Geovisualization Specialist position will be based within the Conservation Science program and will focus principally, but not exclusively, on facilitating use of eBird data by decision-makers and practitioners around the world.  eBird has become one of the world’s largest and fastest growing biodiversity databases, and one that is unparalleled in terms of global coverage and spatiotemporal resolution.  As scientists at the Lab continue to develop innovative approaches to ensure data quality and create robust models of the distribution and abundance of birds, eBird is increasingly in demand to guide management, planning, and policy-making. eBird data is used in a variety of conservation and research projects at academic institutions, governmental departments and agencies in the U.S. and abroad, NGOs, and the private sector.  However, use and application of eBird is often constrained by limited capacity in partner organizations to manipulate eBird data to produce the necessary datasets, maps, and data visualizations.

BBPP will engage the EV for a period of 5 months during the upcoming dry season, beginning in November and lasting through March. The EV is expected to devote at least 40 hrs/week to the project, but due to the nature of the project and living conditions, hours will likely be considerably more. 

The EV will work under the supervision of BBPP Research Camp Managers and other BBPP staff. The EV will split their time between coordinating field-based ecotourism and outreach activities and conducting research (see below). Typical ecotourism activities include, but are not limited to, facilitating short-term visits to research camps by tourists and students, and supporting local staff at the Ureca Nature Center, a small facility cooperatively run by the village of Ureca and the BBPP.

Typical research activities include data collection primarily on the ecology of primates and nesting sea turtles. Turtle research is conducted each evening and focuses on tagging nesting females and gathering reproductive output data on leatherback and green turtles. Researchers will walk an average of 10 km/night while patrolling the beaches. Primate surveys are conducted for 2 weeks each month along established BBPP transects together with a trained team of local survey workers. The EV is also required to participate in daily upkeep and maintenance of the camp, including preparation of meals.

All activities take place in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve (GCSR) in the village of Ureca or at BBPP research camps. Ureca is the only permanent human establishment within the GCSR and was historically isolated until the recent completion of a new road. As such, it remains relatively remote and isolated, with very little services or amenities. Our research camps are in remote areas with no road access, reached by hiking in and out along extremely rough terrain (between 5-13 km depending on camp). Research camp staff will be living in tents, cooking over fire, and using water from nearby streams. The diet is very limited due to lack of electricity/refrigerators. There is no internet connection or phone line. A satellite phone will be available in case of an emergency. The camp does have generators to charge research equipment, which may be used for occasional personal items.

This is an unpaid (volunteer) position. However, BBPP will provide housing (tents), food and local transportation. You are expected to provide international transportation to and from Malabo, Equatorial Guinea (± $2000 for a round trip flight from US), medical and evacuation insurance, appropriate immunizations (yellow fever) and medications (anti-malarial medications). Non-US citizens will need to apply for a visa to enter Equatorial Guinea. We will try to obtain a letter of invitation through the local university in Malabo but cannot guarantee a visa.","Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, West Africa","08/31/2016","Qualifications:

- Spanish language proficiency (minimum conversational)
- Prior field experience in biology, ecology, environmental science, ecotourism, community development, or related disciplines.
- Physical fitness and a positive attitude towards physically exhausting work in a hot and humid climate. All assistants should be prepared for very demanding and time consuming work.

BBPP will engage field assistants for a period of 5 months during the upcoming dry season, beginning in November and lasting through March. Field assistants are expected to devote at least 40 hrs/week to the project, but due to the nature of the project and living conditions, hours will likely be considerably more. 

Field assistants work under the supervision of BBPP Research Camp Managers, Dr. Drew Cronin (BBPP Postdoctoral Researcher), and Dr. Mary Katherine Gonder (BBPP Director). They are encouraged to participate in all aspects of field research during their stay on Bioko Island and may explore additional opportunities to participate in educational outreach projects with local school children as well as training exercises with local wildlife patrols. 

Typical activities include tagging nesting sea turtles and gathering reproductive output data on leatherback and green turtles. Research is conducted every night until 5 am. Assistants will walk an average of 10 km/night while patrolling the beaches. Primate surveys will be conducted during the day for 2 weeks each month along established BBPP transects together with a trained team of local survey workers. Sampling of primate and other mammal feces will also be conducted during the day, but will occur off-trail with the use of a handheld GPS unit. Field assistants are also required to participate in daily upkeep and maintenance of the camp, including preparation of meals. Field assistants will also occasionally assist with and/or participate in a small-scale, local ecotourism project by aiding in the facilitation of short-term visits to research camps by tourists and by demonstrating research methods.

Our field sites are in remote areas with no road access. Researchers and field assistants must hike in and out of the field site(s) (between 5-13 km depending on camp) when necessary along extremely rough terrain. Researchers and field assistants will be living in tents, cooking over fire, and using water from nearby streams. The diet is very limited due to lack of electricity/refrigerators. There is no internet connection or phone line. A satellite phone will be available in case of an emergency. The camp does have generators to charge research equipment, which may be used for occasional personal items. 

This is an unpaid (volunteer) position. However, BBPP will provide housing (tents), food and local transportation. You are expected to provide international transportation to and from Malabo, Equatorial Guinea (± $2000 for a round trip flight from US), medical and evacuation insurance, appropriate immunizations (yellow fever) and medications (anti-malarial medications). Non-US citizens will need to apply for a visa to enter Equatorial Guinea. We will try to obtain a letter of invitation through the local university in Malabo but cannot guarantee a visa.","Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, West Africa","08/31/2016","Field assistants are REQUIRED to: 
- Be at least 21 years old.
- Have a B.A. or B.S. in biology, ecology, environmental science, or related disciplines
- Have Spanish language proficiency (minimum conversational)
- Prior field experience in biology, ecology, environmental science, or related disciplines
Additional Qualifications
- Physical fitness and a positive attitude towards physically exhausting work in a hot and humid climate. All assistants should be prepared for very demanding and time consuming work.

Description of Area:

Perry Wildlife Management Area:
The Kansas Department of Wildlife & Parks has leased 10,500 acres of land at the north end of the Perry Reservoir Project from the U.S. Corps of Engineers since 1970. The area is operated and managed by the Department for wildlife management and public hunting opportunities. 

Description: 
Much of Perry Wildlife Area lies within the Perry Reservoir flood pool, thus flooding is not uncommon. The Delaware River bisects the area from north to south with several small creeks feeding it. The area has a diversity of habits with interspersion of Oak-Hickory woodlands, warm and cool season grasslands, man-made wetlands, and several acres of cropland. 
In the mid 1970's, 11 marsh complexes were built. Two additional marshes were developed after 2000. These marshes provide about 1,000 acres of wetland habitats. The Kyle and West River marshes can be pumped from the Delaware River to provide habitat for migratory birds during dry years. All other wetlands depend on natural run off, thus water levels may vary from year to year. 

Moist soils management is conducted on all marshes which uses water level fluctuations to manage for desirable wetland vegetation beneficial to migratory birds. Periodically, some marshes will be drained in order to conduct dike repairs and control invading woody vegetation and cattails. Management of upland habitats over the years has consisted of converting croplands and cool season grasses to native warm season grasses and forbs, planting of shrub plots, selective cutting of invading woody vegetation, and prescribed burning to stimulate native warm season grasses and forbs. 

White-tailed deer and wild turkey are plentiful on the area. Waterfowl numbers vary depending on available habitat, but the area has supported large numbers during both the fall and spring migrations. Mourning dove numbers vary yearly depending on nesting conditions. Ring-necked pheasant can be found on the area with good numbers on the area. Bobwhite quail populations are good on the area, but a good dog is needed due to the dense vegetation. Squirrel and cottontail rabbit numbers are generally healthy and provide some of the most underutilized hunting opportunities on the area. 

Non-game species are very plentiful on the area and provide some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities. A wide array of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians can be found on the area. 
Fishing for catfish, white bass, and crappie in the Delaware River are also popular activities. Trapping which is allowed on the area, can be a very successful venture due to the wide array of furbearer habitats. 

Special Features 
Handicapped hunting area. Written permission required from manager.
Mentor/Youth hunting area designated for youth 16 years and younger accompanied by no more than one adult per youth.
Delaware River Boat Ramp located south of Valley Falls.
Perry W.A. is heavily used due to its proximity to major metropolitan areas. Opening days and weekends of all seasons are busiest.","$15 - $16 per hour depending on experience and qualifications + Health and Retirement Benefits.","Sarah Piotraschke, HR Specialist","spiotraschke@pheasantsforever.org","http://pheasantsforever.org/jobs",NA,"10/01/2016"

Each year we accept about 6 interns who stay a full year and participate in data collection. The project currently monitors 11 social groups of monkeys. Virtually all monkeys are well habituated, and their genetic relationships are known, as well as social histories dating back several years in most cases.  The primary foci of research currently are (a) vocal communication and bond-testing signals, (b) life history strategies, and (c) the effects of climate change on behavioral endocrinology and population dynamics. 

These internships are excellent preparation for graduate school. Interns who finish their terms have always received admission to high quality graduate programs (>60 of our past interns have gone to graduate school).

Term of Appointment: Optimally, we want people to stay for an entire year. Starting dates are highly flexible (disregard the start dates and application dates below, as we’re accepting applications at any time). We plan to take on two interns during the period of March-May 2016, and another intern every couple of months thereafter. However, sometimes consider shorter contracts for applicants who can fund their own stays entirely, and people who show aptitude in learning the behavioral coding scheme prior to arriving at the site.

Application Deadline: Rolling deadlines: Try to apply at least 1 month before desired start date if possible. We will be hiring 2 more people between the months of Aug-Oct 2016, and more in 2017. We prefer people who can start sooner rather than later.","Guanacaste, Costa Rica","10/01/2016","There are no absolute criteria, and we try to hire people with a blend of different talents. But some traits that help are good grades (>3.3 GPA), some prior Spanish training, and prior experience studying animal behavior and working in the field. Skills in auto mechanics, construction (for house repairs), ecological sampling, computer maintenance and website design would be nice additional perks. The most important trait in a field assistant is strong work ethic and the ability to make a firm commitment for the duration of the contract. Please do not apply if you are the sort of person who signs contracts and then backs out, as such behavior is highly damaging to the project (as well as to your own reputation). It is also highly desirable for applicants to have done some reading in primatology (not just websites, but journal articles and books, including some from this project) before applying.
Application Instructions: Application instructions and a detailed guide to working on the project are on the following website:  
http://lbmp.anthro.ucla.edu/how-to-help/internships/

Please, when you apply, specify the minimum among of financial support you would need in order to be a viable applicant, and state dates of your availability. Please read the detailed guide to working on the monkey project BEFORE applying or contacting the project, as this will answer virtually all questions. Applicants are also strongly encouraged to read the book ""Manipulative Monkeys: The Capuchins of Lomas Barbudal,"" which is a popular science book documenting not only the first 15 years of scientific research, but the life style of researchers working at this site.","Salary/funding: None. However, a field manager positions (which pay a stipend in addition to room and board) will open in January 2017, and this position will be chosen from this year’s group of interns. Currently we are able to provide room and board, but our current grants end in April, so the precise level of funding beyond that point is less certain.

Currently interns are expected to pay a refundable deposit towards their food costs to cover the training period, in case they decide not to stay long enough to contribute useful labor towards the project. The most likely scenario is that food costs will be covered for 11 months of the stay. Assistants must buy their own medical insurance to the site and pay the cost of any visa applications. There is some possibility that the cost of plane tickets to the site could be refunded (depending on the start dates, and current funding). A field site manager will be selected from among the interns, and that person will earn a salary.

Candidates are expected to be willing to work where needed.

Located in coastal counties of Charleston and Berkeley, the 260,000 +/- acre Francis Marion National Forest is one of the most biologically and ecologically diverse forested landscapes in the Southeast.  The forest boundary is formed by the Santee River to the north, the Intracoastal Waterway to the south-southeast, and Lake Moultrie and Cooper River to the west. Within the FMNF boundary, federally owned tracts are distributed in a mosaic of private, county and municipal ownerships.  However, federal lands are generally consolidated in the interior.  The FMNF is subjected to significant urbanization issues, with numerous rapidly growing urban communities found within and adjacent to the proclamation boundary.  As with most national forest land, living adjacent to the FMNF is highly desirable to the public and creates significant pressure on the Forest Service’s ability to appropriately
manage natural resources.  Urban sprawl, coupled with stringent smoke management guidelines and liability laws presents serious challenges to maintaining natural ecosystem functions via prescribed burning on the forest.  Additionally, hurricane Hugo severely impacted the FMNF in 1989, destroying vast numbers of overstory trees, and in some cases, decimating entire forested stands.  Hurricane Hugo removed over 50,000 acres of the pine tree canopy on the Forest. 

The FMNF is comprised of several different landforms, ranging from swamps, floodplains, stream terraces, side slopes, and xeric ridges.  The Forest contains over 30 different natural communities ranging from dry longleaf pine/Turkey Oak woodland to clay-based Carolina bay wetlands.  To date, over 1,600 species of plants have been documented on the forest, which include 32 species of orchids, 22 species of ferns, and 12 species of carnivorous plants. The Forest contributes to surface water of the Santee, Cooper, and Wando rivers, as well as a few small intertidal drainages. There are several groundwater aquifers under the forest and portions of the forest serve as aquifer recharge areas. There are approximately 280 miles of perennial streams and 150,000 acres of palustrine, riverine, lacustrine, and estuarine wetlands on the FMNF.    

The National Forest is situated between two major metropolitan areas: Myrtle Beach (30 miles to the north) and historic Charleston (30 miles to the south).  This part of coastal South Carolina is a popular tourist destination well known for its freshwater and saltwater recreation, golf/tennis, beautiful coastal scenery and historical landmarks dating back to colonial America. The climate is hot and humid in the summer and typically mild in the winter.  

With a population of over 128,000 residents, Charleston is the largest nearby metropolitan area.  However, the towns of Moncks Corner (22 miles), Goose Creek (36 miles), Mount Pleasant (23 miles), and McClellaville (20 miles) are nearby.   

The Francis Marion has an extremely active prescribed burning program, and supports one of the largest populations of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the United States. 
   
Post-secondary education is available at the following locations:  
1) College of Charleston 
2) Trident Technical College in North Charleston 
3) Horry Georgetown Tech in Georgetown  
4) Citadel in Charleston.
5) Charleston Southern

Air transportation is available at the Charleston Regional Airport.  There is an Amtrak station in North Charleston.  South Carolina has an income tax and a sales tax that is 7%.  

Housing prices are variable depending on location, but are significantly higher in Charleston County than Berkeley and Georgetown counties where most of the Francis Marion employees live.  Prices for lakefront or oceanfront property/housing are considerably higher than for off-water property, due to high demand and limited availability in some areas.  Rentals can be difficult to obtain in some areas and prices vary by location.

The Social Sciences Branch conducts research relating to economic and socio-cultural factors of fisheries management, and supports the management process by participating in the development of regulatory alternatives and analyzing resulting impacts. Recently, catch share programs have received an increasing amount of attention.  With the recent addition of new programs in the Northeast and the expectation that more of these types of programs will emerge, the Social Sciences Branch has begun to assess the economic and socio-cultural performance of catch share programs (and, more generally, all NE fisheries).

The Social Scientist will provide analysis and support in the study of fishery catch share systems, focusing on catch accountability. The Social Scientist will assist in developing and documenting an understanding of the relevant costs and benefits associated with catch accountability mechanisms, with a view to assessing their efficiency.

Catch accountability is of particular importance in a catch share system. Stock assessments require accurate data on fishery removals, ACLs (Annual Catch Limits) require accountability to ensure AMs are triggered only when appropriate, and inter-sector ACE trading markets depend on accurate stock-level catch estimates to allocate ACE efficiently. Current catch accountability methods focus on discard monitoring and may not adequately capture the risks associated with illegal/unmonitored landings and/or low discard estimation accuracy. The Social Scientist will help to develop a cost efficiency analysis that incorporates catch accountability strategies such as at-sea monitoring, electronic monitoring, landings obligations/full retention, and dockside monitoring.

The position is full-time with an initial period of performance of one year. The position is eligible for the benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website.

The postdoc would work on the modeling of multi-species fisheries.

Accounting for species interactions in both stock assessment modeling and fisheries management is of increasing interest.  Most current scientific advice for fisheries management is based on results from single species population dynamics models but if fisheries management is to become ecosystem-based, models that consider multispecies interactions are required.  Multispecies models have wide use in research, but not yet in tactical management and require simulation testing to ensure the level of performance expected of tactical fishery assessment models.  Multispecies models “of intermediate complexity” between single population and full ecosystem models potentially combine the best aspects of current single species assessment models with key ecological linkages between species.  The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is currently applying a suite of these models to a simulated system coarsely modeled after the Georges Bank fish community. 

The post-doctoral researcher (PR) will develop and evaluate multispecies models for tactical use in providing fisheries management advice. This innovative research is facilitated by substantial long-term ecological datasets within the region, and built on a foundation of existing models, such that the PR will take the models to the next level where they can be used in a management arena. The PR will collaborate on a project to evaluate the performance of both length- and age-based multispecies approaches for providing management advice.  The primary objective of this work is to assess the impact of structural uncertainty in length- and age-based multi- and single-species population dynamic models on the estimation of underlying population parameters.  This comparison is particularly important for multispecies models, which incorporate an added source of mortality through size-dependent predation.

A general multispecies statistical catch-at-age model has already been developed in AD Model Builder (ADMB).  The length-based multispecies model (Hydra) has also been developed in ADMB but is currently being used as an operating model for multispecies simulation testing.  To evaluate Hydra’s performance as an estimation model, the PR will first convert it from a simulation to estimation model.  Both multispecies models, as well as existing age- and length-based single species models, will then be fit to simulated data to evaluate model performance and examine the consequences of ignoring species interactions in assessment models.  Finally, both multispecies models will be fit to actual observations from Georges Bank to evaluate operational potential within in a particular region.   

The position is expected to last two years with the second year contingent on funding availability and satisfactory progress during the first year. The position is 40 hours/wk with the rate of pay of $28.74/hr ($60,000/yr) and is eligible for the benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website. Start date is flexible.

The research assistant will complete coursework at OSU, help coordinate and conduct fieldwork in Minnesota, and work with collaborators with Audubon Minnesota, National Audubon Society, University of Minnesota, Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, and Minnesota Vikings.

Building collisions are the largest source of bird collision mortality in the United States, causing hundreds of millions of bird deaths each year. Most of this mortality occurs when nocturnal migrants, such as hummingbirds, thrushes, and warblers, collide with windows after being attracted and/or confused by bright lights. The student will help coordinate a scientific monitoring program of bird collisions at Twin Cities buildings, including the newly constructed U.S. Bank Stadium. A major objective of the study is to evaluate how the stadium’s design may be impacting migratory birds; however, the study will also provide a broader conceptual understanding of bird-building collisions by allowing comparisons of collisions at different buildings in relation to their size, location relative to parks and greenspace, and other building and landscape characteristics. Depending on the study’s findings, the research may lead to recommended management actions to reduce bird collisions at the stadium, and findings will broadly inform potential solutions for bird-building collisions.","Stillwater, Oklahoma & Minneapolis, Minnesota","09/09/2016","Required qualifications—Applicants must possess: a B.S. degree in Biology, Ecology, Wildlife Biology, or a related field; a strong work ethic and sense of self-motivation; the ability to collaborate effectively with a diverse group of stakeholders; strong interpersonal and oral and written communication skills; and an interest in being involved with a study with a high public profile.

This position will focus on the urban ecology of ticks, tick-borne diseases, and bird and mammalian hosts. The student will complete coursework on the OSU campus in Stillwater, with fieldwork in parks and greenspaces in the nearby Oklahoma City metro area.

Urbanization substantially alters the distributions of species, interactions among species, and virtually all physical components of natural systems. As a result, urbanization and urban areas are strongly linked to numerous infectious diseases, and the increased risk of encountering vector-borne diseases in urban and suburban areas is a major public health concern. For most vector-borne diseases, very little is known about the ecological factors in urban areas that influence populations of vectors and hosts, vector-host interactions, and the risk of disease transmission in humans. In particular, tick-borne diseases are increasing dramatically in U.S. urban areas, yet few studies have investigated tick populations, tick-host interactions, and tick-borne pathogen prevalence in relation to patterns of urbanization. In the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, the graduate research assistant will: (1) investigate how temperature, humidity, vegetation, and other characteristics of the urban landscape impact tick species diversity and prevalence of tick-borne diseases, and (2) conduct a preliminary assessment of the role of deer and resident bird species as carriers of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. This project will increase ecological understanding of vector-borne disease transmission and have major implications for public health.

The position will begin in January 2017 with support available for 2.5 years ($16,584/yr plus health insurance and tuition waiver).

Oklahoma is the most ecologically diverse state on a mile-for-mile basis, with ecosystem types ranging from forested mountains in the southeast to mesas and canyons in the west.

FAQ’s:

Who can apply?
Anybody!  The Holohil Grant Program is open to scientists and non-scientists from anywhere in the world.
How is my HGP application reviewed?
Holohil is fortunate to have a number of experienced and skilled scientists, biologists, and conservation professionals who have volunteered to be part of the HGP Review Committee .  In addition, Holohil staff are experts in the application of our products and will help to guide reviewers in the appropriateness of projects selected as grant winners each quarter.
Which products are ineligible for the Holohil Grant Program?
All transmitters from the Holohil product line are available for the HGP.  Although, because some units are highly specialized and sometimes require relatively expensive components, some grants may be limited to fewer free units than others.
How many grants are awarded each quarter?
We plan to supply up to CDN$2,000.00 in Holohil transmitters each quarter.  However, if your project requires less than the full dollar amount in products, we may then be able to award transmitters to multiple applicants.  Please consider your project needs carefully.
What if my project wins, but requires more units than the Holohil Grant Program will completely cover?
In this case, the full award amount will be applied (like a credit) to your total Holohil transmitter order.
What should I do with the transmitters after my project ends?
Because all of Holohil transmitters can be refurbished at a fraction of the cost of new units, they can be reused!  You can return them to us for refurbishing (if you plan to subsequently use them yourself), however we encourage you to continue the support of worthy projects by “paying-it-forward” and donating them to another project in need so that they may effectively get a “discount” when they refurbish the units with us.  Please contact us (info@holohil.com) for current refurbishing pricing.
Can I re-apply for a Holohil Grant?
Absolutely!  If you applied and were not awarded a grant during one quarter, you may re-apply in another quarter.
Can I apply for multiple Holohil Grants?
We ask that you only apply for one project per quarter.  However, if you are involved in multiple projects, the same Principle Investigator may apply once each quarter for each project.
Can I find out about the status of my HGP application?
All Holohil Grant Program applicants will be notified by email once we have made our decision and the winning applicant has accepted (see above Deadlines).  Additionally, we will post the name of the winning recipient on our website and social media platforms.

Description

CI seeks to understand the impacts of agro-industry, infrastructure development, climate change and fishing pressure on aquatic freshwater systems that sustain food security and livelihoods in developing countries. To understand these impacts it is important to develop our knowledge of the ecology of the fisheries resources in these systems. The Mekong and Tonle Sap in Cambodia is critically important for food security and livelihoods as well as representing an economic opportunity and exhibiting high levels of biodiversity. Understanding the importance of this biodiversity and what maintians it as well as the productivity of the system is key to protecting and maintaining the diversity and productivity. In order to evaluate these factors CI is evaluating the community structure of fisheries and seeks to understand the morphometric and other elements involved in maintenance of the biodiversity with the ultimate goal of understanding how biodiversity is important to this system as well as to provide insights for other freshwater systems globally and seeks an intern to help with various aspects of this project including time-series data computation and morphometric analysis.

Incoming volunteers can expect to be working on projects related to trail maintenance, upkeep of the field station, construction, gardening, data collection management, etc. Volunteers are considered part of the staff here and play a crucial role is the function and upkeep of the station.

Volunteers are provided lodging in the field station. Accommodations in the field station are rustic but comfortable with beach access out the front door and pristine rain forest out the back. Our station runs entirely on solar energy and our water source is a nearby creek. Volunteers must therefore be flexible and eager to cooperate with the resources available to us.

In the eight decades since, the non-profit Hawk Mountain Sanctuary Association has grown into one of the leading global voices for the conservation of birds of prey by providing international leadership in raptor conservation science and education, and by maintaining Hawk Mountain Sanctuary as a model observation, research, and education facility where tens of thousands of visitors are inspired annually.

Hawk Mountain is in the midst of an exceptional run of success.  Over the past 5 years, Hawk Mountain completed a successful $1.4M campaign to upgrade the education facility that will assist its strategic growth and expansion.  Additionally, Hawk Mountain has completed a campaign to build the first ADA accessible trail to the South Lookout, fortifying its inclusive approach to programming and activities on the mountain.  The Conservation Science program has continued to lead the world in innovative research through its staff scientists and the innovative Conservation Science Trainee program.  

The next President will be offered the opportunity to further this growth by working with the Board of Directors and staff to finalize a new strategic plan that will leverage the capital investments into greater programmatic and research impact and activity.  Growing the endowment is a key priority moving forward in addition to several key programmatic objectives including: enhancing Hawk Mountain stewardship and improving the use of its largely untapped raptor tracking data more fully into the work of the conservation science and education initiatives.","Kempton, PA","08/30/2016","Hawk Mountain Sanctuary seeks an accomplished leader who demonstrates a keen understanding of, and passion for, the organization’s unique mission.

"498","http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/jobs/field-assistant-for-the-hooded-grebe-project-argentina/","The Hooded Grebe Project","Volunteer Openings","Project description
The plateaus of southwest Patagonia, one of the harshest and least protected ecoregions in South America, are home to biodiversity of great conservation value. The Hooded Grebe (Podiceps gallardoi) is endemic to Santa Cruz province (Argentina) and today, only 40 years from its discovery, it is listed as critically endangered (BirdLife International / UICN) and facing extinction.
The Hooded Grebe Project consists of a professional and committed team that works extensively in the area since 2009, studying the grebes’ biology, identifying the root causes of its greatest threats and generating direct-action programs and conservation strategies that have already helped the population to start recovering.

The conservation measures include intense fieldwork (specifically research and control of invasive species), habitat restoration, local conservation education and promotion of laws that protect the species and its habitat.

After 7 years of intense work, the Hooded Grebe has become a symbol for Patagonias threatened wildlife and the applied conservation measures are showing first tangible results. 
The Biological Station “Juan Mazar Barnett” was recently built in order to create a space for scientists that are interested in continuing and expanding research in the area. It is now a basecamp for biologists, archaeologists and many local and international students and volunteers interested in participating at the process of saving this beautiful species.

Volunteering at the Hooded Grebe Project

Our obstacles are immense. The Hooded Grebe´s breeding range is huge, its threats are many and for a few months, we need to be fast and everywhere at the same time in order to protect the Grebe´s most important breeding colonies.
We are looking for volunteers who are motivated by passion and genuine interest in biodiversity conservation and research. We require commitment, initiative, sacrifice and a willingness to go above and beyond. 
We need adventurers, people who like the idea of camping in the wild, rough and windy deserts of the high plateaus of western Patagonia, who enjoy certain isolation, extreme weather conditions and never ending trips on bad roads and nearly inexistent tracks. A volunteer should be able to withstand long periods without a hot shower, without internet and phone communication, camping conditions and long walks for fieldwork. Volunteers should be in GOOD physical shape and health to participate in the program. 
We know from experience that a volunteer of the Hooded Grebe Project needs to be flexible (able to accept last minute changes of plan and delays), have a good sense of humour and a proactive attitude, be respectful towards the other volunteers and team members, show interest for the different cultures, accept and embrace their differences, help out and do more than his share (wash dishes, wake up early, offer to help) and have fun. 
Last but not least, not everything is harshness, isolation and wind in Patagonia. The team is an interesting mix of biologists, parkrangers, students, adventurers and naturalists who enjoy good meals at night, good music and long conversations. Of all ages and from all over the world, there are many different stories to hear and - most importantly – there´s a general huge passion about saving the Hooded Grebe. We hope participants will enjoy themselves, make new friends, and learn about Patagonia and conservation.
It’s a life changing experience for those who are up to the challenge. 
Tasks to be undertaken
•	Acuatic bird censuses.
•	Shorebird censuses.
•	Data collection on breeding colonies of the Hooded Grebe.
•	Monitoring (census and detection) of invasive and exotic species such as American Mink and Kelp Gull.
•	Support to colony guardians (detection and control of factors affecting the colonies).
•	Monitoring of wildlife (mammals, amphibians and reptiles).
•	Collaboration in maintenance of work equipment.
•	Promotion and local educational work.
•	Housework (cooking, cleaning, collecting firewood) and maintenance of common spaces at the Biological Station.
•	Restoration of habitat and working areas (dismantling of ranch fences in the Patagonia National Park, building of trails, road repair and control of invasive plant species).
•	Support for capturing and marking Hooded Grebe individuals.
Volunteers are not expected to be formally prepared nor to present official study degrees, but more importantly to be interested in learning and contributing to the project.


Important information

Please take the time to read the following information thoroughly and in full, as your application signifies to us that you understand the basic conditions and are willing to comply with these agreements. Any breaches of these agreements may result in suspension or termination of your volunteer status.

Due to the remoteness and long distances between destinations, and to optimize logistics and transportation planning, volunteering periods would rotate every 15 days, and go as follow:
For periods of at least 30 days volunteering in the project, from the months of December to April, these cycles will be commencing on the 1st and 15th days of each month, and ending on the 1st of the following month, and 15th respectively.  All of these dates are based on arrival and departure from the town of Perito Moreno, on the North-West of the Santa Cruz province.

As an example for further understanding:

Volunteer is picked up in Perito Moreno on the 1st of January, and volunteering process finishes on the 1st of January.
Or, volunteer is picked up in Perito Moreno on the 15th of January, and volunteering process finishes on the 15th of February.




A limited number of volunteer staff slots are allocated for the following periods:
•	15th December (2016) – 15th January (2017)
•	1st January – 1st February
•	15th January – 15th February
•	1st February – 1st March
•	15th February – 15th March
•	1st March – 1st April
•	15th March – 15th April
The number of volunteers per each slot is to be determined according to the amount of different activities to be carried out on different stages of the breeding season, and the level of workforce needed for these.
We suggest you inform us on your interest for which slot you would like to apply for, and we will allocate the applicants on a capability and “first come - first serve” basis.
Applicants interested in volunteering for periods longer than 30 days will be given priority during selection and volunteer period preference allocation.  This is because during a longer period of time, volunteers can learn more about the functioning of the Project, thus are more helpful to it by being experienced on the carried out tasks.
Logistics
If you are accepted to the volunteer program, you will receive detailed logistical information. 
To give you a sense of what to expect: You will need to arrive at a little town called “Perito Moreno”, in northwest Santa Cruz province, Argentina. (Make sure you are not getting information of how to go to “Perito Moreno glacier”, or “Perito Moreno National Park”, since that is not where we will pick you up.) 
Once you arrive in Perito Moreno, a team member will pick you up and take you to the Biological Station.
Cost of the program
Running the volunteer program comes with numerous expenses for us: food, salaries for leaders and coordinators, camping and research equipment, insurance, transportation, showers/ bathrooms, and more. To help offset some of these costs, the program cost is US$ 20 per day (600 per session). 
This covers the volunteer expenses once arrived at the project. It includes training, transportation, food, camping equipment and lodging throughout the entire stay. 
If your stay exceeds 60 days, we are able to reduce the amount requested to US$ 15 per day.
We will ask you to pay the program cost in cash during your first days at the project. Unfortunately, we cannot accept any other way of payment.
By deciding to join us, we expect that volunteers have read and agreed to the expectations of the program. While you are with us, we need you to respect our policies and staff leadership. Those who do not do so will be asked to leave the program, without the possibility of being refunded.

Weather conditions
Weather conditions in Patagonia are harsh and they change dramatically by the season and by the hour: winds over 60 mph (100 km/h) and temperatures that may vary from below freezing to near 90ºF (30ºC) in one day, plus very high levels of solar irradiation due to low levels of humidity in the atmosphere. 
If you are accepted to the volunteer program, you will receive a detailed equipment list.
Communication
There is no internet access and no cell phone service anywhere closer than 100km from the Biological Station, and the satellite phone is for emergency use only. You will have the chance to communicate with your family and friends every time you go to town, but this probably won´t be often (except for emergencies). Plus, internet service in town can be spotty and frustratingly slow. If connectivity is important to you, consider this when making your decision to volunteer. 
Food
The food is hardy and typical to Patagonia: lots of stews and soups, lamb, potatoes and bread. In the field, volunteers cook together on a basic camp stove. Ingredients in the field are limited—think simple camping cooking. 
If you’re a vegetarian please know that Patagonia is not an easy place to eat meat-free, as meat is a major part of the diet, but this should not be a reason for not participating at the project. 
Language
The volunteer program is mostly local, and only a little part international. We do not expect participants to be totally bilingual since most of the team members speak English fluently, but experience showed that most conversations take place in Spanish. Not understanding conversations at dinner or on endless roadtrips can make volunteers feel uncomfortable or excluded if they are too shy to ask for a language switch. Still, this should not stop you from coming.

We require commitment, initiative, sacrifice and a willingness to go above and beyond. 
We need adventurers, people who like the idea of camping in the wild, rough and windy deserts of the high plateaus of western Patagonia, who enjoy certain isolation, extreme weather conditions and never ending trips on bad roads and nearly inexistent tracks. A volunteer should be able to withstand long periods without a hot shower, without internet and phone communication, camping conditions and long walks for fieldwork.

Veterinary supervision and protocols of care are observed.

Summer student positions will be filled on a six week rotational basis, with four time main frames to fill, however positions are available year-round:
April 15 – May 31
June 1 – July 15
July 16 – August 31
September 1 – October 15
The work at the wildlife centre can be very demanding. Typically in the summer we work from 8 am until 10 pm, with occasional 4 am feedings. A summer student can expect to be involved in all aspects of the rehabilitation process. Most of the work for everyone is diet preparation and cleaning, but you will also be expected to take part in occasional rescues and releases, administer treatments, participate in building projects and grounds maintenance, and some educational displays within the community. The schedule at the centre can be intense, but you will also be given time to enjoy the beautiful scenery this island has to offer.
Summer student positions are unpaid and typically last six to eight weeks, depending on scheduling. The wildlife centre offers very basic housing and, occasionally, some meals, but for the most part you will be responsible for keeping yourself fed.
The wildlife centre is staffed by two dedicated rehabilitators and many volunteers. As a summer student you will become part of a team of like minded people and will be treated with respect and friendship.","Courtenay, British Columbia, Canada","12/31/2016","Previous wildlife experience is not a prerequisite.

By volunteering with OHP, you will be contributing to the research and conservation goals of the project. It is a two week position based in Sumatra which includes a 5 day trek into the GunungLeuser National Park. 

Possible research tasks at base:
•	Taking pictures and drying collected plant samples
•	Keeping temperature, humidity and weather records updated
•	Helping to maintain the project base
•	Entering behavioural data
•	Making new herbariums of important medicinal plant species
Tasks in the forest:
•	Helping to collect medicinal plant samples  that will be further analyzed in Europe
•	Locating areas with a significant wild orangutan population
•	Finding and following orangutans to collect behavioural data, faecal and plant samples

As a volunteer you will learn the day in day out tasks of the project and be given presentations about the project research, orangutan parasites and the problems surrounding the National Park. You will also gain an insight into the local culture and how to act appropriately.

The most important fact - there will be absolutely NO physical contact with the orangutans. If you are hoping to come so that you can cuddle one of these amazing creatures, then this is not for you. This rule will be strictly enforced if necessary. We also cannot guarantee encounters with orangutans – our research focuses on wild orangutans and much of our work therefore takes place in areas where the orangutans themselves can be quite elusive, often staying high up in the canopy or traveling to other areas where more fruit is in season.

The Booth lab at The University of Tulsa is currently seeking M.Sc and
Ph.D students. Four projects are available:

1)      Identifying the genomic signatures of host-associated
differentiation. Through genome resequencing of 22 lines of
haematophagous insect and the availability of two annotated reference
genomes, we seek to understand genes driving differentiation to
alternative mammalian hosts. This project will be primarily
bioinformatic as the genome resequencing has taken place. This may also
include transcriptomic and microbiomic components.

2)      Spatiotemporal metapopulation dynamics and host-species
expansion of a disease-vectoring avian ectoparasite. Using both nuclear
and mitochondrial markers, we aim to understand variation in the
temporal and spatial structure of an avian ectoparasite undergoing both
a population range expansion and a host-species expansion. This project
has the potential to include both genomic and microbiomic aspects also.

3)      Understanding the dynamics of rapid and pervasive mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and recombination. Using a mitogenomic approach this
project seeks to 1) assess the influence of mitogenomic divergence on
the frequency of paternal leakage driven heteroplasmy; 2) to
empirically and theoretically evaluate heteroplasmy decay; and 3)
determine whether recombination hotspots can be detected within the
mitochondrial genome.

4)      A genomic assessment of facultative parthenogenesis in snakes.
We have generated RAD-Seq data for parthenogens, their mothers, and in
one case, their offspring. Using this data, and two published genomes,
we seek to address two main questions. 1) Can we identify the
automictic mechanism underlying the production of parthenogens? This
may be either terminal fusion or gametic duplication; and 2) what are
the genomic characteristics of parthenogenesis and also sexual
reproduction by facultative parthenogens, and can these be detected in
wild populations?

Project Background: Attwater Prairie Chicken NWR, located approximately 60 miles west of Houston, Texas, is one of the largest remnants of coastal prairie habitat remaining in southeast Texas and home to one of the last populations of the critically endangered Attwater's prairie chicken (APC), a ground-dwelling grouse of the coastal prairie ecosystem.  Formerly occupying some 6 million acres of coastal prairie habitat, the APC was once one of the most abundant resident birds of the Texas and Louisiana tall grass prairie landscape, though currently only about 100 birds exist in the wild. Efforts to propagate and release APCs into the wild have been ongoing since 1992 and 1996, respectively. Monitoring of released birds is critical to understanding recovery limitations and in managing the species in the wild.  Less than 200,000 fragmented acres of coastal prairie habitat remain, leaving the birds scattered in solely two Texas counties.  Recovery activities for this imperiled bird and management of its rapidly declining ecosystem go beyond the refuge's boundaries.

 

Position Description: The ACE intern will work directly with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on varied ecological projects and programs within the refuge supporting the management and stewardship of the refuge's resources; protecting and ensuring the survival of the APC and its habitat, allowing the population to reach a measurable level of ecological and genetic stability so that it can be reclassified to threatened status (downlist) and ultimately removed from the endangered species list (delist). As a result, APC recovery must focus on three primary areas:

   1) habitat management

   2) captive and wild population management

   3) public outreach, which includes professional development 

Specific Intern duties include but are not limited to:

Assist in APC recovery efforts by building predator deterrent fences around nests and removing them after nesting season
Caring for and monitoring APC broods

Physical Requirements:  This internship position requires physical exertion such as walking over wet and rough surfaces, bending, crouching, stooping, lifting or reaching.  Hand and finger dexterity and physical coordination may involve fine and precise procedures, delicate adjustments or exact measurements.

Position Environment:  Duties are performed both indoors and outdoors.

2 weeks - 1225 EURO including accommodation, meals and experiences! 
The project has simplified the course to “easy to understand” practical subjects and lectures in order that the student/volunteer can apply the knowledge, thus acquired, immediately to the bush experience. 
The training program and study course is designed to bring the student/volunteer in close contact with nature, wildlife and conservation, encourage eco-friendly utilization of South Africa’s nature and wildlife resources, point out ways and methods to generate revenue to be re-invested in conservation and preservation. The programme includes lectures from the FGASA (Field Guides Association of Southern Africa) Level I modules, such as: 
• Reptiles: Southern Africa is blessed with an abundant number of diverse reptiles. This lecture will introduce you to the three orders of indigenous reptiles: chelonians (shield reptiles, ie, with a shell), the Nile crocodile and scaled reptiles, including snakes – how to ID them and with emphasis on their fang structure and venom type. 
• Birds: there are over 950 bird species in southern Africa. This introductory lecture will teach you basic bird classification and biology as well as characteristics to look for to help with bird identification, knowledge that we will take out and put into practice in the Bush! 
• Mammals: on what basis are mammals classified? What is their social structure and what do they eat? How do you tell if the animal is male or female? How long do they live? All is explained in this comprehensive lecture! 
• Animal Behaviour: in the lecture room we will give you a basic understanding of an animal’s behaviour which is part of the animal’s habitat interaction. This lecture is brought to life in the Bush as we observe animal’s without intrusion to give you an understanding of their natural behaviour. 
All-in-all there are 17 modules and apart from the set modules listed above, we give you the option to choose other lectures that suit your interests as we cannot possibly cover all modules in a two-week period! 
Practical experience is gained on morning and afternoon Bush walks and on sunrise / sun-downer / night drives. We also cover conservation management with practical experience in the Bush, which could include alien plant control, erosion management or maintaining roads, etc. 
The following experiences are included:- 
• Kruger National Park - a two-day, overnight stay in the world-famous park! Two full days in Kruger, covering some 600kms from Orpen to Skukuza where you will camp (subject to availability) overnight, sitting by the camp fence enjoying their braai (bbq) dinner as the hyaenas patrol close-by on the other side! An early start on day two will take you far south in the park and across from west-to-east before heading back north-and-west to exit at Orpen. We cover all kinds of eco-systems – open savannahs, riverine areas, bushveld scrub – and needless to say, sightings are generally plentiful and often phenomenal! 
• A half-day Reptile Ranger Course: Anyone can walk through the Reptile Park and leave with a few nice photos, but what else? They take you to do the educational and interactive 4-hour Field Guide Course! After a power-point introduction, the Park Curator will show you around. There are all kinds of snakes as well as crocodiles, bearded dragons, iguanas, monitor lizards, scorpions and spiders. You can feed the plated lizards & a chameleon; and then watch as a snake is fed. In a live demonstration, the Curator will teach you about snake behaviour, fang structure and venom types using a Puff Adder, Boomslang and Snouted Cobra. You will also have the chance to hold a Golden Baboon Spider, a protected spider of the region! Scared of snakes and spiders? You won’t be after this course: respect, not fear! 
• Full day Blyde Canyon mountain hike: a leisurely day in the beautiful mountains with natural streams and waterfalls. Plenty of areas in which to dive in and swim in nature’s natural pools. In the fresh, unpolluted air doesn’t take your breath away the natural scenery will! 
• The Poaching Crisis – what can we do?: a powerful and passionate educational day concerning the issues our country faces with poaching: Hunting vs Poaching - what is the difference?, and Crime Scene management – a sad indictment of the times we live in as trainee guides are now taught how to manage a crime (poaching) scene 
• A half-day wildlife rehabilitation centre tour: a haven for the care of abandoned, injured and poisoned wildlife. Wildlife is brought to the centre from all corners of South Africa, and, once healthy enough, are re-introduced into their natural environments. Those creatures which cannot be returned to the wild due to the nature and extent of their injuries are cared for at the centre and are used to educate the many people who visit each year, both from across South Africa and abroad. The tour includes cheetah, lions, leopard, hyaena, every kind of eagle, Ground Hornbill, caracal, serval, honey badger and the chance to feed vultures! 
We also endeavour to introduce community work in to the programme where we can as we forge ties with the Green Kidz Initiative – an education-driven project that introduces local children to the value of wildlife & nature - and Nourish, a passion-driven initiative to uplift local communities through satellite farming projects, maintaining infrastructure for crèches, toy libraries, etc. 
You’ll wonder how we can also fit in a trip to the Glencoe baobab, the second largest baobab in South Africa which has been carbon-dated to be almost 3,000 years old. In its prime, this baobab stood with a diameter of 15.9 m (52 ft) with a circumference of 47 m (154 ft) and at a height of 17 m (56 ft), and the spread of crown 37.05 m (121.6 ft).","Kruger National Park South Africa","01/01/2017","Passion for wildlife

DESCRIPTION:  Currently, lead ammunition (shotgun slugs and rifle bullets) is allowed for hunting deer on National Wildlife Refuges. There are concerns that this use of lead may pose a problem for some wildlife, particularly scavengers who feed on remains such as viscera. We are searching for an MS student to be part of a collaborative project to evaluate the attitudes, values, and norms that direct stakeholder behavior in terms of their choice of ammunition for deer hunting on wildlife refuges. The student will work closely with hunters, conservationists, state and federal agency personnel, ammunition industry representatives, and other stakeholders to interview or survey hunters to determine, among other things, their views on using various kinds of ammunition, their understanding of the goals of nontoxic ammunition use, and their experiences using alternative ammunition such as copper slugs or bullets. The student will be working towards an MS in the Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology Concentration in the Department of Environmental Conservation at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst (http://eco.umass.edu/) and will be closely associated with the

Position Description:  

Background: Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge is approximately 10,000 acres in size and is located in Okmulgee Co. Oklahoma.  Feral hogs first appeared on the refuge several years ago and they are recognized in the Refuge's Pest Management Plan.  The detrimental impacts of feral hogs to native species are well documented and hogs are accepted as one of the most imminent threats to vulnerable habitats and native species across the United States.  Direct impacts include competitions for food resources, habitat destruction and predation on native species.  Additional indirect impacts of rooting activities include alteration to successional vegetative patterns through disruption of regeneration, soil disturbance that leads to establishment of other invasive species, and rooting activities near riparian areas that also increases siltation and subsequently degrades streams that affect fish as well as other aquatic species.  Hog removal and control is a top priority for the refuge.

Duties and Responsibilities: The ACE intern will be responsible for baiting, trapping, and disposing of feral hogs on refuge lands to reduce hog numbers in these units prevent the spread of feral hogs into additional refuge units and adjacent private lands and to provide resources for early detection rapid response if hogs cross into currently unoccupied units.  Duties will also include scouting for hog sign in occupied units, establishing hog trap locations, erecting corral traps (with the help of refuge staff), installing game cameras, monitoring traps, and filling feeders.  The intern will also be responsible for collecting GPS data at trap sites as well as monitoring unoccupied units and the outer refuge boundary for any sign of hog presence and collecting GPS coordinates of areas where new hog sign is observed. Refuge staff will be responsible for the dispatch of hogs once trapped.  GPS and ArcMap will be used for monitoring coverage and success.

The study assesses demographics and resource selection of greater sage-grouse in response to grazing.  The study also evaluates the direct effects of grazing on vegetation in sage-grouse habitat.  This collaborative project is led by Lorelle Berkeley, Ph.D., Research Wildlife Biologist with Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP); Dr. David Naugle, Professor, College of Forestry and Conservation, The University of Montana and Science Advisor to NRCS’s Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI); Joe Smith, Ph.D. Candidate, The University of Montana College of Forestry and Conservation; and Mark Szczypinski, Conservation Technician, FWP.
The crew leader will supervise (and assist) a crew of 4 range technicians who have been hired to collect detailed vegetation data at sage-grouse nests and random points among grazing treatments across the study area.  The crew leader reports directly to and works very closely with the Conservation Technician on the project who oversees the entire field crew.  Crew leader responsibilities include daily organization of the crew, their tasks, and the locations in which they are sampling.  The crew leader also oversees data entry and management of the technicians, including collecting data forms on a regular basis and ensuring the crew keeps up with data entry and proofing, and will do a lot of data entry and proofreading themselves.  The crew leader will use ArcGIS to upload waypoints to maps and print maps for field technicians on a daily basis.  Microsoft Access is used for database entry and maintenance – preference will be given to applicants who know how to use Access.  In addition to regular field duties with the crew, the crew leader is responsible for supervision of the crew and ensuring that field gear and vehicles are properly maintained. Regular field duties will include collecting vegetation data but may also include duties associated with sage-grouse such as capturing and marking hens or chicks, monitoring hens or chicks via radio-telemetry, or other miscellaneous tasks as assigned.    If you do not have current First Aid / CPR certification, you must become certified before arriving to begin work. The range crew works alongside our sage-grouse field crew and helps with sage-grouse capture and monitoring when needed.   The range and sage-grouse technicians are considered one field crew with slightly different designations of daily duties, but they will each help each other with duties when necessary.  Regular communication and coordination of range crew activities with the sage-grouse crew is imperative; thus the range crew leader must have excellent communication and inter-personal skills.  The work schedule is extremely dynamic and demanding, including late nights, early mornings, some long days during the peak of nests hatching, and unpredictable days off—applicants must be willing to work when needed and take days off when the opportunity arises.  Applicants must enjoy working and living in a remote rural area with a diverse group of people including private landowners and livestock producers.  Conditions include extreme temperatures, rain, snow, “gumbo” roads, wind, rattlesnakes, and abundant prickly pear.  The rewards include the endless vistas of central Montana, abundant recreation opportunities within a short (1-2 hour) drive, calf branding and roadside chats with ranchers, phenomenal wildlife viewing, and field research experience. A strong work ethic, good physical condition, and sense of humor are a must.  Wages are a monthly stipend of $2,332 per month plus free housing with the field crew and internet. The successful candidate will be hired through the University of Montana’s Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit but will be supervised by FWP staff.  There are no benefits associated with this position.  Applications will be accepted until March 11, 2016 but may be filled earlier if a suitable candidate is found.  To apply, e-mail a cover letter, résumé, and 3 professional references all within a single MS Word attachment to Lorelle Berkeley at:  lberkeley@mt.gov; AND Mark Szczypinski at: mszczypinski.fwp@gmail.com.  Please mention whether or not you are currently certified in CPR/First Aid and direct any questions about the position to Mark via e-mail or by phone at 406-320-2529.

Project Summary:
The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a sagebrush-obligate species that was recently up for ESA listing.  The loss and degradation of the sagebrush habitats has led to extirpation of this species from over half of its historical range.  Due to large conservation efforts and cooperation by multiple agencies and private landowners to conserve and manage sage-grouse habitat, the sage-grouse was not listed.  To void consideration of this species for ESA in the future, these conservation efforts need to continue.  Our study evaluates the direct effects of grazing on sage-grouse vital rates (hen survival, nest success, chick survival—the 3 most important drivers of population growth in greater sage-grouse) and habitat.  Findings will inform federal and state grazing management programs as well as landowners that incorporate wildlife interests into grazing management around the West.

Summer Scholar Obligations and Activities: Student Scholars will be placed with the Oregon Sea Grant Program, a federal or state agency, or non-governmental organization, and will assist host agencies with field work, lab work, analysis, research, policy development, and/or outreach and public engagement efforts. They will be assigned to a specific project under a mentor and will be expected to dedicate at least 40 hours a week to the program. The program will provide students with training on subjects such as ecosystem-based management, professional and scientific communication, field- and lab-based scientific methods, natural resource policy development, public outreach, and roles of federal, state and local governments in natural resource management. The program will include field trips within Oregon and an opportunity for students to present their summer work. Scholars will be expected to participate in all program activities and complete a final project report during the final week of their experience.

Selection Process: Applications will be reviewed by the Program Leader, Program Coordinator and a small selection committee. Top candidates will be interviewed by video conference by the selection committee. Up to nine students will be selected based on the following criteria:
•Academic achievement, especially in natural and social sciences
•Writing and ability to articulate academic and professional goals
•Letters of recommendation
•Verbal communication skills, as demonstrated during interview
•Alignment of applicant interests, goals, and skills with the needs of host agencies and mentors

Award: Selected students will be awarded a $4,000 stipend to offset living expenses during the ten-week fellowship. Student housing will be provided to those students who need it at no cost to the student. A small number of need-based assistance grants may be available to cover travel expenses; these will require a supplemental application once students are selected.","Multiple cities in Oregon","08/22/2016","Any undergraduate student who will have completed the equivalent of two years of full time study by June 13, 2016 and who is currently enrolled in any U.S. college or university, or who will have graduated during the 2015-2016 academic year, may apply.

Gain great experience now! Please note, this is a complete volunteer experience that requires a project fee covering room and board, and your own transportation to Belize. If that is not an impediment, continue reading... We seek 3-5 motivated field assistants for our wild cat study in Belize, Central America. This study focuses on jaguars, pumas, and ocelots using non-invasive detection methods. Volunteers will gain extensive field experience working on a multi-faceted wildlife conservation project in a beautiful tropical country. Non-invasive methods include setting up large remote camera grids across tropical broadleaf and/or tropical pine forests. Includes extensive GPS and orienteering and may include habitat surveys. The study researches the long-term demographics of felid populations and the the impacts of selective logging at multiple sites across Belize. 

Rustic village living conditions in a tropical environment (that means potentially very hot and humid weather, snakes, biting insects, and various other creepy-crawleys). Includes extensive hiking to reach remote camera stations and to collect vegetation data surrounding camera stations.

We are seeking a candidate with experience analyzing ecological data sets, such as examining responses of a taxon or community over an environmental gradient or large spatial scale, multi-trophic interactions, or experience working with environmental response in organisms from more than one trophic level. Over 200,000 oil and methane gas sites in the Bakken oilfield are projected to impact close to 1 million acres of northern plains rangeland by 2030. This disturbance is dispersed into five to ten-acre oil and gas well pads, connected by pipelines and roads. As each well ends production, the site must undergo revegetation to restore sites to productive rangeland. Revegetation is an opportunity to not only reclaim sites, but also to improve surrounding rangeland and agricultural lands through better water retention, invasion resistance, pollinator services, and pest control. The post-doc will direct field data collection, help analyze an existing dataset of soil function, plant community composition, insects, and birds in 40 undisturbed reference sites across a large spatial extent, and analyze future datasets of soil function, plant community composition, insect, bird, and other animal habitat across gradients of disturbance. Depending on their interests, the post-doc will also have the opportunity to develop additional winter greenhouse experiments and collaborate in other projects.
